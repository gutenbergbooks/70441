<h2 class="nobreak" id="INTRODUCTION">INTRODUCTION<br>
<span class="fs80">By SIR W. R. BIRDWOOD</span></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">It is my privilege to have been asked to write an Introduction for <span class="smcap">The
Anzac Book</span>, and to convey the cordial thanks of all the inhabitants of
our little township here to those who have so kindly given us the free use
of their brains and hands in writing and illustrating this book in a way which
does as much credit to them as the fighting here has done to the Force. We
all hope that readers of our book will agree in this, while those who are more
critical will perhaps remember the circumstances under which the contributions
have been prepared, in small dug-outs, with shells and bullets frequently whistling
overhead.</p>

<p>It may be of interest to readers to hear the origin of the word “Anzac.”</p>

<p>When I took over the command of the Australian and New Zealand Army
Corps in Egypt a year ago, I was asked to select a telegraphic code address
for my Army Corps, and then adopted the word “Anzac.” Later on, when
we had effected our landing here in April last, I was asked by General Headquarters
to suggest a name for the beach where we had made good our first
precarious footing, and then asked that this might be recorded as “Anzac
Cove”—a name which the bravery of our men has now made historical, while it
will remain a geographical landmark for all time.</p>

<p>Our eight months at “Anzac” cannot help stamping on the memory of
every one of us days of trial and anxiety, hopes, and perhaps occasional fears,
rejoicings at success, and sorrow—very deep and sincere—for many a good
comrade whom we can never see again.</p>

<p>I firmly believe, though, it has made better men of every one of us, for we
have all had to look death straight in the face so often, that the greater realities
of life must have been impressed on all of us in a way which has never before
been possible. Bitter as has been my experience in losing many a good friend,
I, personally, shall always look back on our days together at “Anzac” as a time
never to be forgotten, for during it I hope I have made many fast friends in
all ranks, whose friendship is all the more valuable because it has been acquired
in circumstances of stress and often danger, when a man’s real self is shown.</p>

<p>In days to come I hope that this book will call to the minds of most of us
incidents which, though they may then seem small, probably loomed very large
before us at the time, and the thought of which will bring to mind many a good
comrade—not only on land, but on the sea. From the day we were put ashore<span class="pagenum" id="Page_x">[Pg x]</span>
by Rear-Admiral Thursby’s squadron up till now we have had the vigilant ships
of His Majesty’s Navy watching night and day, in all weathers, for any
opportunity to help us. We will all of us look back in years to come on
<em>Queen Elizabeth</em>, <em>Prince of Wales</em>, <em>London</em>, <em>Triumph</em>, <em>Bacchante</em>, <em>Grafton</em>,
<em>Endymion</em>, as well as such sleuth-hounds of the ocean as <em>Colne</em>, <em>Chelmer</em>,
<em>Pincher</em>, <em>Rattlesnake</em>, <em>Mosquito</em>, and many others, as our best of friends, and
will think of them, their officers and ship’s company, as the truest of comrades,
with whom it has been a privilege to serve, and as the best of representatives of
the Great Fleet and Service which carries with honour and ensures respect for
the British flag to the uttermost parts of the earth.</p>

<p>Boys! Hats off to the British Navy.</p>

<p>It may be that, in thinking of old “Anzac” days, the words of the
Harrow school-song will spring to one’s mind:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Forty years on, growing older and older,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Shorter in wind, as in memory long,</div>
    <div class="verse indent1">Feeble of foot, and rheumatic of shoulder,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">What will it help you that once you were strong!”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>But it has indeed helped us all to have been with strong men at “Anzac,”
and whatever the future may have in store, I, personally, shall always regard the
time I have been privileged to be a comrade of the brave and strong men from
Australia and New Zealand, who have served alongside of me, as one of the
greatest privileges that could be conferred on any man, and of which I shall be
prouder to the end of my days than any honour which can be given me.</p>

<p>No words of mine could ever convey to readers at their firesides in Australia,
New Zealand and the Old Country, one-half of what all their boys have been
through, nor is my poor pen capable of telling them of the never-failing
courage, determination and cheerfulness of those who have so willingly fought
and given their lives for their King and country’s sake. Their deeds are known
to the Empire, and can never be forgotten, while if any copy of this little
book should happen to survive to fall into the hands of our children, or our
children’s children, it will serve to show them to some extent what their fathers
have done for the Empire, and indeed for civilisation, in days gone by.</p>

<p>I sincerely hope that every one of my old comrades may meet with all the
good fortune his work here has deserved, and live to a ripe old age, with happiness,
and be occasionally reminded of old times by a glance at <span class="smcap">The Anzac
Book</span>.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="EDITORS_NOTE">EDITOR’S NOTE</h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">This book of Anzac was produced in the lines at Anzac on Gallipoli in
the closing weeks of 1915. Practically every word in it was written
and every line drawn beneath the shelter of a waterproof sheet or of a
roof of sandbags—either in the trenches or, at most, well within the range
of the oldest Turkish rifle, and under daily visitations from the smallest
Turkish field-piece. Day and night, during the whole process of its composition,
the crack of the Mauser bullets overhead never ceased. At least one good
soldier that we know of, who was preparing a contribution for these pages,
met his death while the work was still unfinished.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Anzac Book</span> was to have been a New Year Magazine to help this little
British Australasian fraternity in Turkey to while away the long winter in the
trenches. The idea originated with Major S. S. Butler, of the A.N.Z.A.C.
Staff. On his initiative and that of Lieutenant H. E. Woods a small committee
was formed to father the magazine. A notice was circulated on November
14th calling for contributions from the whole population of Anzac. Any profit
was to go to patriotic funds for the benefit of the Army Corps.</p>

<p>Between November 15th and December 8th, when the time for the sending
in of contributions closed, <span class="smcap">The Anzac Book</span> was produced. As drawings and
paintings began to come in, disclosing the whereabouts of some of the talent
which existed in Anzac, a small staff of artists was collected in order to produce
head- and tail-pieces and a few illustrations; and a dug-out overlooking Anzac
Cove became the office of the only book ever likely to be produced in Gallipoli.</p>

<p>It was after the contributions had been finally sent in, and when the work
of editing was in full swing, that there came upon most of us from the sky the
news that Anzac was to be evacuated. Such finishing touches as remained to
be added after December 19th were given to the work in Imbros. The date
for the publication was necessarily delayed. And it was realised by everyone
that this production, which was to have been a mere pastime, had now become
a hundred times more precious as a souvenir. Certainly no book has ever been
produced under these conditions before.</p>

<p>Except for this modification in the scheme of its production, <span class="smcap">The Anzac
Book</span> remains to-day exactly the same as when it was planned for the Australian
and New Zealand Army Corps still clinging to the familiar holly-clothed sides
of Sari Bair.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_xiv">[Pg xiv]</span></p>

<p>The three weeks during which this book was being produced will be remembered
by the men of Anzac as being the period during which we were visited
by the two fiercest storms which descended upon the Peninsula. During the
afternoon of November 17th the wind from the south-west gradually increased
to more than half a gale, and brought with it, after dark, a most torrential
thunderstorm. A day or two later this subsided, leaving a dishevelled Anzac.
But the wind swung slowly round to the north, and by November 27th it was
blowing a northerly blizzard; and the next day five out of every six Australians,
for the first time in their lives, woke to find a white countryside and the snow
falling. How deeply that snow impressed them can be seen in these pages—for
dust, heat and flies were much more typical of Gallipoli.</p>

<p>The book was composed from first to last in the full prospect of Christmas
at Anzac, and it remains a record, perhaps, all the more interesting on that
account. The Printing Section of the Royal Engineers, especially Lieutenant
Tuck and Corporal Ashwin, and Lieutenant G. L. Thomson, R.N.A.S., and
certain Naval Officers helped us with some drawing-paper, ink and paints, and
the Photographic Section with some excellent panoramas; but for the rest, the
contributors had to work with such materials as Anzac contained: iodine
brushes, red and blue pencils, and such approach to white paper as could be
produced from each battalion’s stationery.</p>

<p>The response to the committee’s request for contributions was enormous,
and in consequence the editors have been able to use only portions, even if
they be a half or a quarter, of the longer articles and stories submitted to them—but
they have done this without hesitation, rather than reject the articles
altogether. The competitions for certain contributions resulted as follows:
<span class="smcap">Cover</span>—Private D. Barker, <em>5th Australian Field Ambulance</em>; <span class="smcap">Drawing</span>—Trooper
W. O. Hewett, <em>9th Australian Light Horse</em>; <span class="smcap">Drawing</span> (<em>Comic</em>)—Private
C. Leyshon-White, <em>6th Australian Field Ambulance</em>; <span class="smcap">Prose Sketch</span>—H.
Dinning, <em>9th Co., Australian A.S.C.</em>; <span class="smcap">Prose</span> (<em>Humorous</em>)—Second-Lieutenant
J. E. G. Stevenson, <em>2nd Field Co., Australian Engineers</em>; <span class="smcap">Verses</span>—Captain
James Sprent, <em>3rd Australian Field Ambulance</em>; <span class="smcap">Verses</span> (<em>Humorous</em>)—T.
H. Wilson, <em>A Co., 16th Battalion A.I.F.</em> The greater number of the

<p class="drop-cap">Come on, lads, have a good,
hot supper—there’s business
doing.” So spoke No. 10
Platoon Sergeant of the 10th
Australian Battalion to his men, lying
about in all sorts of odd corners aboard
the battleship <em>Prince of Wales</em>, in
the first hour of the morning of
April 25th, 1915. The ship, or her
company, had provided a hot stew of
bully beef, and the lads set to and took
what proved, alas to many, their last
real meal together. They laugh and
joke as though picnicking. Then a
voice: “Fall in!” comes ringing down
the ladderway from the deck above.
The boys swing on their heavy equipment,
grasp their rifles, silently make
their way on deck, and stand in grim
black masses. All lights are out, and
only harsh, low commands break the
silence. “This way No. 9—No. 10—C
Company.” Almost blindly we
grope our way to the ladder leading to
the huge barge below, which is already
half full of silent, grim men, who seem
to realise that at last, after eight
months of hard, solid training in Australia,
Egypt and Lemnos Island, they
are now to be called upon to carry out
the object of it all.</p>

<p>“Full up, sir,” whispers the midshipman
in the barge.</p>

<p>“Cast off and drift astern,” says the
ship’s officer in charge of the embarkation.
Slowly we drift astern, until the
boat stops with a jerk, and twang goes
the hawser that couples the boats and
barges together. Silently the boats are
filled with men, and silently drop astern
of the big ship, until, all being filled,
the order is given to the small steamboats:
“Full steam ahead.” Away we
go, racing and bounding, dipping and
rolling, now in a straight line, now in
a half-circle, on through the night.</p>

<p>The moon has just about sunk below
the horizon. Looking back, we can see
the battleships coming on slowly in our
rear, ready to cover our attack. All at
once our pinnace gives a great start
forward, and away we go for land just
discernible one hundred yards away
on our left.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_2">[Pg 2]</span></p>

<p>Then—crack-crack! ping-ping! zip-zip!
Trenches full of rifles upon the
shore and surrounding hills open on us,
and machine-guns, hidden in gullies or
redoubts, increase the murderous hail.
Oars are splintered, boats are perforated.
A sharp moan, a low gurgling
cry, tells of a comrade hit. Boats
ground in four or five feet of water
owing to the human weight contained
in them. We scramble out, struggle
to the shore, and, rushing across the
beach, take cover under a low sandbank.</p>

<p>“Here, take off my pack, and I’ll
take off yours.” We help one another
to lift the heavy, water-soaked packs
off. “Hurry up, there,” says our
sergeant. “Fix bayonets.” Click!
and the bayonets are fixed. “Forward!”
And away we scramble up the
hills in our front. Up, up we go,
stumbling in holes and ruts. With a
ringing cheer we charge the steep hill,
pulling ourselves up by roots and
branches of trees; at times digging our
bayonets into the ground, and pushing
ourselves up to a foothold, until, topping
the hill, we found the enemy had
made themselves very scarce. What
had caused them to fly from a position
from which they should have driven us
back into the sea every time? A few
scattered Turks showing in the distance
we instantly fired on. Some fell to rise
no more; others fell wounded and,
crawling into the low bushes, sniped
our lads as they went past. There were
snipers in plenty, cunningly hidden in
the hearts of low green shrubs. They
accounted for a lot of our boys in the
first few days, but gradually were
rooted out. Over the hill we dashed,
and down into what is now called
“Shrapnel Gully,” and up the other
hillside, until, on reaching the top, we
found that some of the lads of the 3rd
Brigade had commenced to dig in. We
skirted round to the plateau at the head
of the gully, and took up our line of
defence.</p>

<p>As soon as it was light enough to
see, the guns on Gaba Tepe, on our
right, and two batteries away on our<span class="pagenum" id="Page_3">[Pg 3]</span>
left opened up a murderous hail of
shrapnel on our landing parties. The
battleships and cruisers were continuously
covering the landing of troops,
broadsides going into the batteries
situated in tunnels in the distant hillside.
All this while the seamen from
the different ships were gallantly rowing
and managing the boats carrying
the landing parties. Not one man that
is left of the original brigade will hear
a word against our gallant seamen.
England may well be proud of them,
and all true Australians are proud to
call them comrades.</p>

<br>

<p>Se-ee-e-e ... bang ... swish! The
front firing line was now being baptised
by its first shrapnel. Zir-zir ... zip-zip!
Machine-guns, situated on each
front, flank and centre, opened on our
front line. Thousands of bullets began
to fly round and over us, sometimes
barely missing. Now and then one
heard a low gurgling moan, and, turning,
one saw near at hand some chum,
who only a few seconds before had been
laughing and joking, now lying gasping,
with his life blood soaking down
into the red clay and sand. “Five
rounds rapid at the scrub in front,”
comes the command of our subaltern.
Then an order down the line: “Fix
bayonets!” Fatal order—was it not,
perhaps, some officer of the enemy
who shouted it? (for they say such
things were done). Out flash a thousand
bayonets, scintillating in the sunlight
like a thousand mirrors, signalling
our position to the batteries away on
our left and front. We put in another
five rounds rapid at the scrub in front.
Then, bang-swish! bang-swish! bang-swish!
and over our line, and front,
and rear, such a hellish fire of lyddite
and shrapnel that one wonders how
anyone could live amidst such a
hail of death-dealing lead and shell.
“Ah, got me!” says one lad on my
left, and he shakes his arms. A bullet
had passed through the biceps of his
left arm, missed his chest by an inch,
passed through the right forearm, and
finally struck the lad between him and
me a bruising blow on the wrist. The<span class="pagenum" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</span>
man next him—a man from the 9th
Battalion—started to bind up his
wounds, as he was bleeding freely. All
the time shrapnel was hailing down on
us. “Oh-h!” comes from directly
behind me, and, looking around, I see
poor little Lieutenant B——, of C
Company, has been badly wounded.
From both hips to his ankles blood is
oozing through pants and puttees,
and he painfully drags himself to
the rear. With every pull he moans
cruelly. I raise him to his feet, and
at a very slow pace start to help him
to shelter. But, alas! I have only got
him about fifty yards from the firing
line when again, bang-swish! and we
were both peppered by shrapnel and
shell. My rifle-butt was broken off to
the trigger-guard, and I received a
smashing blow that laid my cheek on
my shoulder. The last I remembered
was poor Lieutenant B—— groaning
again as we both sank to the ground.</p>

<p>When I came to I found myself in
Shrapnel Gully, with an A.M.C. man
holding me down. I was still clasping
my half-rifle. Dozens of men and
officers, both Australians and New
Zealanders (who had landed a little
later in the day), were coming down
wounded, some slightly, some badly,
with arms in slings or shot through the
leg, and using their rifles for crutches.
Shrapnel Gully was still under shrapnel
and snipers’ fire. Two or three platoon
mates and myself slowly moved down
to the beach, where we found the
Australian Army Service Corps busily
engaged landing stores and water amid
shrapnel fire from Gaba Tepe. As
soon as a load of stores was landed,
the wounded were carried aboard the
empty barges, and taken to hospital
ships and troopships standing out offshore.
After going to ten different
boats, we came at last to the troopship
<em>Seang Choon</em>, which had the 14th
Australian Battalion aboard. They
were to disembark the next morning,
but owing to so many of us being
wounded, they had to land straightaway.</p>

<p>And so, after twelve hours’ hard
fighting, I was aboard a troopship again—wounded.
But I would not have
missed it for all the money in the
world.</p>

<p>[It may be necessary to explain that wood—for the roof-beams of dug-outs
and the shoring up of trenches in wet weather—was priceless in Gallipoli. But
whilst this book was being compiled Providence sent a storm. In the morning the
beach was littered with portions of a wrecked schooner, stranded lighters, pieces
of pier—all strictly the property of H.M. Government as represented by the
officer commanding the Royal Engineers. “A gift from Heaven,” one Australian
was heard to remark as he looked at the desolate scene next morning. Nor were
his British brethren less grateful.—Eds.]</p>
</div>
<br>

<p class="drop-cap">
The storm had ceased, the sea was calm, the wind a trifle raw,<br>
And miles and miles of wreckage lay upon the sandy shore;<br>
And every time the waves came up they brought a little more.<br>
<br>
The Sergeant and the Junior Sub. in contemplation stood.<br>
They wept like anything to see such quantities of wood—<br>
And then they smiled a furtive smile which boded little good.<br>
<br>
The wood lay round in lovely heaps and smiled invitingly.<br>
“Do you suppose,” the Sergeant said, “that this is meant for me?”<br>
“I doubt it,” said the Junior Sub. “Here comes the C.R.E.<a id="FNanchor_1" href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a><br>
<br>
“If fifty kings and fifty queens and fifty C.-in-C.’s<br>
Presented fifty indents and bowed low upon their knees,<br>
I hardly think that they would get more than a few of these.”<br>
<br>
The Sergeant and the Junior Sub. walked on a mile or so,<br>
Until they found a shelving bank conveniently low;<br>
And there they waited sadly for the C.R.E. to go.<br>
<br>
“Oh, timbers,” quoth the Junior Sub., who spoke with honeyed speech,<br>
“I hardly think it <em>safe</em> for you to lie upon the beach.”<br>
And as he spoke he stroked the backs of those within his reach.<br>
</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</span></p>

<p class="no-indent">
The timbers leapt beneath his touch and hurried plank by plank;<br>
They crowded round to hear him speak, and lined up rank on rank—<br>
But one old timber wagged his head and hid behind a bank.<br>
<br>
“The time has come,” the Sergeant said, “to talk of many things—<br>
Of bully beef and dug-outs, of Kaisers and of Kings,<br>
And why the rain comes through the roof, and whether shrapnel stings.<br>
<br>
“Some good stout planks,” the Sergeant cried, “are what we chiefly need,<br>
And four by fours and spars besides are very good indeed—<br>
So if you’re ready, sir, I think we may as well proceed.”<br>
<br>
“Oh, C.R.E.!” remarked the Sub., “I deeply sympathise.”<br>
With sobs and tears they sorted out those of the largest size,<br>
While happy thoughts of days to come loomed large before their eyes.<br>
<br>
Next morning came the C.R.E. to see what could be done;<br>
But when he came to count the planks he found that there was none—<br>
And this was hardly odd, because they’d collared every one.<br>

IN 1930</h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">When you come to an old
spotted gum right on the
saddle of Sandstone Ridge,
after an eighteen-mile ride
from Timpanundi, you’re very close to
Freddy Prince’s war selection. There’s
a well-made gate in the road fence on
your left, and it bears the legend,
“Prince’s Jolly.” Through that the
track will lead you gently uphill into a
wide and gradually deepening sap,
until you think you’ve made some
mistake. Then look to your left, and
behold the front entrance to Freddie’s
dug-out.</p>

<p>An old shell-case hangs near by,
and when you strike it you’ll hear
an echo of children’s voices, and a
small platoon of youngsters charge you
at the double. First time I blew in it
was just on teatime, and my first
glance in at the well-lit gallery and the
smell of the welcome food are worth
the recollection. Fred came out and
led my cuddy round to the stable sap,
where he was given what had been on
his mind for some hours past. I didn’t
lose much time in settling down to tea—it
was already too dark to look around
outside. Besides, as Fred explained,
there was nothing to see of the homestead
bar the inside, and by the third
year of excavation most of that had
been dumped into the gully and pretty
well all washed away.</p>

<p>The meal finished, we played games
with the kids. Fred seldom read the
papers—he said he didn’t want to strain
the one eye that was left to him—so
Mrs. Prince retired to absorb the news
I had brought in their mail-bag, and
to prepare herself to issue it to her
husband later.</p>

<p>Long after the children went to
burrow, he and I smoked and pitched
away about the past. He told me how
he and many others had come to adopt
the underground home. It had been
the case of making a penny do the work
of a pound, and Fred himself had done
the work of a company. It had been
a hard struggle, but the missus was a
treasure, and never growled except
when things were going well—as some
people will do. It was just a case of
dig in, dig up, and dig down. Anything
in the way of iron or steel was
prohibitive. Timber was too expensive,
and in any case the timber that
stood on the selection he had been
forced to sell in order to stock the farm.
It had been a problem of years, but he
had made a job of it; and when he
showed me round the house I didn’t
grudge him his little bit of pride.</p>

<p>The main gallery opened to the surface<span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</span>
at the front and back, and was
about forty-five paces long. It was
driven through hard ground, and was
well arched so that it required no timber.
On one side there was a branch
to the pantries and the galley, and on
the other side the dining-room and the
bedrooms, which were really one big
chamber with solid pillars of earth left
at intervals, forming a group of rooms
each with a dome roof and canvas partitions.
A borehole had been put
through to the surface at the centre of
every room for ventilation and light, a
device of reflectors enabling one to
bring the sunlight in at all hours of the
day.</p>

<p>Once, as we sat and smoked, a subdued
chattering came from the adjoining
room. I looked up and saw the top
of a periscope over the partition. Instantly
it disappeared with a noise like
the scattering of furniture. Then a
voice: “Oh, daddy, do you know
what?”</p>

<p>“What’s happened, Kit?” replied
the father.</p>

<p>“Two of your biscuit photo-frames
are smashed.”</p>

<p>“Oh, never mind, old girl,” said
Fred; “it’s time they began to break
up after fifteen years. Go to sleep,
both of you.”</p>

<p>As I lay awake next morning I overheard
some homely details. How the
baldy steer had hopped over O’Dwyer’s
parapet into his lucerne patch; and
Jimmy ought to have widened the
trench last week when he was told to;
and the milking sap hadn’t been
cleaned out the previous day because
Georgie had forgotten he was pioneer;
and Jerry O’Dwyer had shot two crows
from the new sniper’s pozzy<a id="FNanchor_2" href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> down at
the creek—and so on.</p>

<p>When we sat down to breakfast Mrs.
Prince was primed with news. “I told
Fred,” she said, “I didn’t believe we’d
taken Lake Achi Baba; the latest cable
says it’s still occupied by the German
submarines.” Fred nodded as if he
didn’t care much.</p>

<p>“Achi Baba used to be a hill once,
wasn’t it, daddy?” chipped in one of
the youngsters.</p>

<p>“Yes, it used to be one time,” replied
his father, looking into the blue
puffs that drifted away from his pipe
and out past the waterproof sheet of
the dug-out door. In those blue
mists of the past what he saw was
the bald pate of the great hill, with
the howitzers tearing earth out of
the crest of it by the hundredweight,
while the Turkish miners ever heaped
the outside of it with the spoil from
their tunnels. “Yes, it was a hill
once.”</p>

<p>Thus Freddy and his wife and family
live their life as happily as if there were
no war.</p>

</div>

<p class="drop-cap">It’s the monotony we revile, not—to
a like degree—hard work or
hard fare. To look out on the same
stretch of beach or the same patch
of trench wall and the same terraces of
hostile black and grey sandbags day
after day is to be wearied. There is
the same sitting in the same trench,
shelled by the same guns, manned, perhaps
(though that we endeavour to
avert), by the same Turks. Unhappily
it is not the same men of ours that they
maim and kill daily.</p>

<p>And if one’s dug-out lies on a seaward
slope there is, every morning, the
same stretch of the lovely Ægean,
with the same two islands standing over
in the west.</p>

<p>Yet neither the islands nor the sea
are the same any two successive days.
The temper of the Ægean at this time
changes more suddenly and frequently
than ever does that of the Pacific.
Every morning the islands of the west
take on fresh colour, and are trailed by
fresh shapes of mist.</p>

<p>To-day Imbros stands right over
against you; you see the detail of the
fleet in the harbour, and the striated
heights of rocky Samothrace reveal the
small ravines. To-morrow, in the early
morning light, Imbros lies mysteriously
afar off like an Isle of the Blest, a
delicate vapour-shape reposing on the
placid sea.</p>

<p>Nor is there monotony in either
weather or temperature. This is the
late autumn. Yet it is a halting and
irregular advance the late autumn is
making. Fierce, biting, raw days
alternate with the comfortableness of
the mild late summer. This morning,
to bathe is as much as your life is worth
(shrapnel disregarded); to-morrow, in
the gentle air, you may splash and
gloat an hour and desire more. And
you prolong the joy by washing many
garments.</p>

<p>Here in Anzac we have suffered the
tail-end of one or two autumn storms,
and have had two fierce and downright
gales blow up. The wind came in the
night, with a suddenness that found
us most unprepared. In half an hour
many of us were homeless, crouching
about with our bundled bedclothes,
trespassing tyrannically upon the confined
space of the stouter dug-outs of
our friends—a sore tax upon true
friendship. They lay on their backs
and held down their roofs by mere
weight of body until overpowered.
Spectral figures in the driving atmosphere
collided and wrangled and swore
and blasphemed. The sea roared over
the shingle with a violence that made
even revilings inaudible.</p>

<p>The morning showed a sorry beach.
There were—there had been—three
piers. One stood intact; the landward
half of the second was clean gone; of
the third there was no trace, except in
a few splintered spars ashore. A collective
dogged grin overlooked the
beach that morning at the time of
rising. The remedying began forthwith;
so did the bursting of shrapnel
over the workmen. This stroke of
Allah upon the unfaithful was not to
go unassisted.</p>

<p>With misgiving we foresee the winter
robbing us of the boon of daily
bathing. This is a serious matter.
The morning splash has come to be
indispensable. Daily at six-thirty you
have been used to see the head of
General Birdwood bobbing beyond the
sunken barge inshore; and a host of
nudes lined the beach. The host is
diminishing to a few isolated fellows,
who either are fanatics or are come<span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</span>
down from the trenches and must clear
up a vermin-and-dust-infested skin at
all costs.</p>

<p>Not infrequently “Beachy Bill”
catches a mid-morning bathing squad.
There is ducking and splashing shorewards,
and scurrying by men clad only
in the garment Nature gave them.
Shrapnel bursting above the water in
which you are disporting raises chiefly
the question: “Will it ever stop?”
By this you mean: “Will the pellets
ever cease to whip the water?” The
interval between the murderous lightning
flash aloft and the last pellet-swish
seems, to the potential victim,
everlasting.</p>

<p>The work of enemy shell behind the
actual trenches is peculiarly horrible.
Men are struck down suddenly and unmercifully
where there is no heat of
battle. A man dies more easily in the
charge. Here he is wounded mortally
unloading a cart, drawing water for his
unit, directing a mule convoy. He
may lose a limb or his life when off
duty—merely returning from a bathe
or washing a shirt.</p>

<p>One of our number is struck by
shrapnel retiring to his dug-out to read
his just delivered mail. He is off duty—is,
in fact, far up on the ridges overlooking
the sea. The wound gapes in
his back. There is no staunching it.
Every thump of the aorta pumps out
his life. Practically he is a dead man
when struck; he lives but a few
minutes—with his pipe still steaming,
clenched in his teeth. They lay him
aside in the hospital.</p>

<p>That night we stand about the grave
in which he lies beneath his groundsheet.
Over that wind-swept headland
the moon shines fitfully through driving
cloud. A monitor bombards off<span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</span>
shore. Under her friendly screaming
shell and the singing bullets of the
Turks the worn, big-hearted padre intones
the beautiful Catholic intercession
for the soul of the dead in his
cracked voice.</p>

<p>At the burial of Sir John Moore was
heard the distant and random gun.
Here the shells sometimes burst in
the midst of the burial party. Bearers
are laid low. A running for cover.
The grave is hastily filled in by a couple
of shovel-men; the service is over; and
fresh graves are to be dug forthwith
for stricken members of the party. To
die violently and be laid in this shell-swept
area is to die lonely indeed. The
day is far off (but it will come) when
splendid mausolea will be raised over
these heroic dead. And one foresees
the time when steamers will bear up the
Ægean pilgrims come to do honour at
the resting places of friends and kindred,
and to move over the charred
battlegrounds of Turkey.</p>

<p>Informal parades for Divine Service
are held on Sabbath afternoons for such
men as are off duty. Attendances are
scanty. The late afternoons are becoming
bleak; men relieved from
labour seek the warmth of their dug-outs.</p>

<p>The chaplain stands where he can
find a level area and awaits a congregation.
When two or three are gathered
together he announces a hymn. The
voices go up in feeble unison, punctuated
by the roar of artillery and the
crackle of rifle fire. The prayers are
offered. The address is short and shorn
of cant. This is no place for canting
formula. Reality is very grim all
round. There is a furtive under-watchfulness
against shrapnel. One almost
has forgotten what it is to sit in security
and listen placidly to a sermon at
church.</p>

<p>The chaplains have come out to do
their work simply and laboriously.
They are direct-minded, purposeful
men. One is a neighbour in a Light
Horse regiment—a colonel. He flaunts
it in no sandbagged palace. His dug-out
is indistinguishable from those
of the privates between whom he is
sandwiched—mere waterproof sheet
aloft and bed laid on the Turkish clay;
a couple of biscuit boxes with his oddments—jam,
and milk, and bread:
writing materials and toilet requisites.
A string line beneath the roof holds his
towel and lately washed garments. He
is a simple parson, hard-worked by day
and night in and about the trenches,
careful for such comforts as can be got
for his men in this benighted land;
lying down at nights listening to the
forceful lingo of his neighbours, and
confessedly admiring its graphic if well-garnished
eloquence. He sees his duty
with a direct gaze—a faithful Churchman
at work in the throes of war.</p>

<p>In a land of necessarily hard fare a
regimental canteen in Imbros does
much to compensate. Unit representatives
proceed thence weekly by
trawler for stores. One feels almost
in the land of the living when so near
lie tinned fruit, butter, cocoa, coffee,
sausages, sauces, chutneys, pipes,
tobacco, and chocolate. Such a repertoire,
combined with a monthly visit
from the paymaster, removes one far
from the commissariat hardships of
the Crimea.</p>

<p>The visualising of unstinted civilian
meals is a prevalent pastime. Men sit
at the mouths of their dug-outs and
relate the minutiæ of the first dinner at
home. Some men excel in this. They
do it with a carnal power of graphic
description which makes one fairly
pine. One has heard a colonel-chaplain
talk for two hours of nothing but
grub, and at the end convincingly
exempt himself from any charge of
carnal-mindedness. Truly we are a
people whose god is their belly. But
that we never admitted until this period
of enforced deprivation.</p>

<p>Those comforts embraced by the use
of good tobacco and deliverance from
vermin at night are the most desired;
both hard to procure. There is somehow
a great gulf fixed between the
civilian quality of any tobacco and the
make-up of the same brand for the
Army. Once in six months a friend in
Australia dispatches a parcel of cigars.
Therein lies the entrance to a fleeting
paradise—fleeting indeed when one’s
comrades have sniffed or ferreted out
the key. After all, the pipe, given
reasonably good tobacco, gives the
entrée to the paradise farthest removed
from that of the fool.</p>

<p>Of the plague of nocturnal vermin
little need be said explicitly. The
locomotion of the day almost dissipates
the evil. But it makes night hideous.</p>

<p>The tendency is to retire late and
thus abridge the period of persecution.
One’s friends drop in for a yarn or
a smoke after tea, and the dreaded
hour of turning-in is postponed by
reminiscent chit-chat and the late preparation
of supper. One renews, here,
a surprising bulk of old acquaintance.
Old college chums are dug out,
and one talks back and lives a couple
of hours in the glory of days that have
passed. Believe it not that there is no
deliverance possible from the hardness
of active service. The retrospect, and
the prospect, and the ever-present
faculty of visualisation are ministering
angels sent to minister.</p>

<p>Mails, too, are an anodyne. Their
arrival eclipses considerations of life and
death—of fighting and the landing of
rations. The mail-barge coming in
somehow looms larger than a barge of
supplies. Mails have been arriving
weekly for six months, yet no one is
callous to them.</p>

<p>Of incoming mail, letters stand inevitably
first. They put a man at home
for an hour.</p>

<p>But so does the local newspaper.
Perusing that, he is back at the old
matutinal habit of picking at the news
over his eggs and coffee, racing against
the suburban business train. Intimate
associations hang about the reading of
the local sheet—domestic and parochial
associations almost as powerful as are
brought by letters.</p>

<p>And what shall be said of parcels
from home? The boarding-school
home-hamper is at last superseded. No
son, away at Grammar School, ever
pursued his voyage of discovery
through tarts, cakes and preserves,
sweets, pies and fruit with the intensity
of gloating expectation in which
a man on Gallipoli discloses the contents
of his “parcel.”</p>

<h3>I<br>
FROM SHELL GREEN</h3>

<p class="no-indent fs90"><em>From a Correspondent in Australian
Field Artillery, “Sea View,” Boltons
Knoll, near Shell Green.</em></p>

<p class="drop-cap">I was looking out from the entrance
of my dug-out, thinking
how peaceful everything was,
when Johnny Turk opened on our
trenches. Shells were bursting, and
fragments scattered all about Shell
Green. Just at this time some new
reinforcements were eagerly collecting
spent fuses and shells as mementoes.
While this fusillade was on, men were
walking about the Green just as usual,
when one was hit by a falling fuse.
Out rushed one of the reinforcement
chaps, and when he saw that the man
was not hurt he asked: “Want the
fuse, mate?”</p>

<p>The other looked at him calmly.</p>

<p>“What do you think I stopped it
for?” he asked.</p>


<h3>II<br>
THE TURK IN THE
PERISCOPE</h3>

<p class="no-indent fs90"><em>The same Correspondent writes:</em></p>

<p class="drop-cap">I am sure that wherever the old
5th Light Horsemen, who put in
such a warm spell at “Chatham’s”<a id="FNanchor_4" href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a>
some time ago, congregate
after this war the following
incident will be told and retold:</p>

<p>Bill Blankson was a real hard case,
happy-go-lucky, regardless of danger.
Bill was put on sapping for over a fortnight,
and at the end of that time had
a growth of stubble that would have
brought a flush of pride to his dirty
face if he had seen it. But he hadn’t
seen it—one does not carry a looking-glass
when sapping.</p>

<p>At the end of the fortnight he was
taken off sapping and put on observing.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</span></p>

<p>Anyone who has used a periscope
knows that unless the periscope is held
well up before the eyes, instead of the
landscape, one sees only one’s own
visage reflected in the lower glass.</p>

<p>Bill did not hold the periscope up
far enough, and what he saw in it was
a dark, dirty face with a wild growth
of black stubble glaring straight back
at him. He dropped the periscope,
grabbed his rifle, and scrambled up the
parapet, fully intending to finish the
Turk who had dared to look down the
other end of his periscope.</p>

<p>He had mistaken his own reflection
for a Turk’s.</p><br>

<p class="drop-cap">One of the chief pastimes of
the Turks who live behind
the black and white sandbags
opposite (writes an officer
who knows them intimately) is that
of listening to stories told by the
storytellers in the cafés of the Asia
Minor villages. The hero of these
stories is very often a certain Nastradi
Hodja (who really existed at one time,
and made a reputation by his wit as well
as through his stupidity). Here is an
example of the sort of story about
Nastradi which especially pleases the
Turk:</p>

<p>Nastradi Hodja’s wife woke up one
night through hearing a noise. She got
up, and going out on to the landing on
the upper floor, outside her bedroom,
called out:</p>

<p>“Nastradi, what was that noise?”</p>

<p>Nastradi’s voice came up from below.
“Don’t pay any attention to it,” he
said. “It was only my shirt that
tumbled down the stairs.”</p>

<p>“Does a shirt make such a noise?”
she asked.</p>

<p>“No,” was the reply; “but I was
in it.”</p>

</div>

<p class="drop-cap">It was a fine day, and they were
standing by waiting for instructions
from the warrant officer to
commence unloading and loading;
and in the general murmur of voices
one noted the broad tones of the British
Tommy and the harsher ones of
Tommy Kangaroo, the latter less careful
of his grammar than the other; also
the loud-voiced directions of the Indian
Tommy, or rather Johnny, who condescended
now and then to break into
pidgin-English (with a smile).</p>

<p>Presently from amongst a group sitting
in the shelter of a stack of bully
beef came the request: “Give us a
light, mate,” in the blunt style which
belongs to Tommy Kangaroo.</p>

<p>“Aw, yes,” replies Tommy Atkins,
or “Kitch,” as he is beginning to be
called. “Aw, yes.” And while the
other is pulling at his fag: “Have you
got any baadges, choom?”</p>

<p>“No, I gave mine to a little nipper
who used to sing on the stage at the El
Dorado in Cairo.”</p>

<p>“Did you now! She must have a
fine stack of baadges now, that ’un.
You’re about the fifteenth lad that I
know has given his baadges to ’er.
Aw, thanks”—taking back his cigarette.
“I see you’re from Austra-alia.
What State did you live in?”</p>

<p>“Vic,” is the reply.</p>

<p>“I wonder if you knew my brother?
He went to Victoria a couple of years
ago. Got a job on the ra-ailways, he
did, and wanted me to come out too.
I’ll go when this is over; but ’ee’s
married now, ’e is, and got a couple of
pet lambs that ’e said was given to ’im
by a chap named Drover; ’is name is
Dobbs.”</p>

<p>“Never met him, matey, but he
is all right, you bet. A Pommy<a id="FNanchor_5" href="#Footnote_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a>
can’t go wrong out there if he isn’t too
lazy to work.”</p>

<p>“Ah, yes, he tells me they called ’im
Pommy, but that they was good lads.
I could not understand them slinging
off at ’im and ’im thinking they were
treatin’ ’im like as ’e was one of themselves.”</p>

<p>“Oh, well, yer see, mate, we don’t
call the like of ’im ‘Pommies’ because
we dislike ’em, but just as a matter of
description. Of course, sometimes one
of ’em gets ’is back up and calls us sons
of convicts in return for us chuckin’ off
at ’im, and then he’s told lots of things—sometimes
true and very often untrue;
but Australia’s all right, mate.
You need not be ashamed to be called a
‘Pommy’ out there.”</p>

<p>“Blime, there’s old ‘Beachy’<a id="FNanchor_6" href="#Footnote_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> at it
again,” breaks in another. “’Ee’s a
fair cow, ’e is. Made me spill two
buckets er water this mornin’, and our
flamin’ cook told me I was too lazy to
go down for it. I’ll give ’im ‘Beachy’<span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</span>
after this job is over if ’e don’t look
out. Hallo, Johnny, Beachy catch-em
mule, eh?”</p>

<p>“Beachy no good—mule good,”
replies the tall spare Indian, with a
smile, as he tries to bring his pair of
mules under the shelter of the stack.
“Mule very good,” he says, as he
squats in front of his pair.</p>

<p>“’Ow long yer been ’ere, choom?”
asks Kitch of Kangaroo.</p>

<p>“Nearly six munce now. Blime, I
could do with a spell now, too. I’m
beginnin’ to get a ’ump like a camel
from carryin’ these flamin’ boxes.”</p>

<p>“Aw, yes, but it’s better than bein’
in the trenches, ain’t it?” asks Kitch.</p>

<p>“Blime, no,” is the reply. “A
man’s got a chance to hit back there,
but down ’ere it’s up to putty. It’s
bad enough to be eatin’ bully beef, but
carryin’ it as well is rotten. I couldn’t
look a decent bullock in the face now
for what I’ve said about ’im when ’e’s
tinned.”</p>

<p>“Did yer ’ear wot was doin’ up at
Narks Post larst night, Bill?”</p>

<p>“Yes; some d——d gobblers
thought they would catch our mob
nappin’ but missed the bus, and some
of ’em are still runnin’ yellin’ to Aller
to stick to ’em. Blast ’em! I’ll give
’em Aller when I get a chance. Keepin’
a man stuck on ’ere when ’e might
be havin’ a good time somewhere else.
I’ll bet——”</p>

<p>“Come on, Bill, ’ere comes the
W.O.,”<a id="FNanchor_7" href="#Footnote_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> says his mate.</p>

<p>“D—— ’im—see yer later, matey;
and I’ll try to get a badge for yer.”</p>

<p>“Don’t forget, choom. Ah want
it to send to my married sister’s little
lass. She thinks youm lads be prime
boys.”</p>

<p>“Prime boys,” mutters Bill, as he
grabs his case of bully. “Yes, prime
boys jugglin’ Best Prime Bully Beef.”</p>

<p>“D—— it—shut up, Bill,” says his
mate. “You’re always growlin’—you’ll
want flowers on your grave
next.”</p>

<p class="drop-cap">Outside was a cold, dark,
windy and cheerless night,
and the world seemed cowering
under the black, threatening
rain-pall above, which could be felt
rather than seen. Inside my host’s
diggings we were lounging back in the
warmth and light, smoking and yarning
of other times and places, while the
partner of his home brewed the warm,
fragrant, comforting decoction which
seemed to contribute so much to the
mood and proper appreciation of such
friendly comfort in the midst of the
audible turmoil of unfriendly outer
circumstances.</p>

<p>Once again from outside there came
a whir and rattle past the door, and I
smiled significantly and glanced in that
direction.</p>

<p>“Oh, don’t go until after the next
one,” urged my host’s companion, seeing
my attention diverted to things
outside of our present cheery circle.</p>

<p>With this my friend seemed to concur,
and drew himself closer to the fire.
“Yes, there’s plenty of time yet,” he
said. “There’ll be a lot more of ’em.
So you might as well sit tight in, safely
and comfy, and try another cup.”</p>

<p>I didn’t need much coaxing, and
thrusting the thought of the long, unpleasant
journey home out of my mind,
I settled down to further cheery chat
and the enjoyment of stimulating
internal comforts.</p>

<p>The conversation seemed to have
progressed but a little further when
above the wind outside could be heard
again the warning roar and rumble,
fading away and terminating in a
muffled clang and clatter in the distance.
“That settles it, Billo, old
chap,” I said, half rising. “Pass over
my coat. If I hurry off now I’ll be
just in time.”</p>

<p>But my friend didn’t move to oblige.
“Now, what’s the use of hurrying?”
he urged once more. “They’ll be passing
every minute now for a long time
yet. So why not settle down and
enjoy yourself a bit longer? ’Taint
very often you come this way.”</p>

<p>By the time I had finished my reply
to his persuasions I found, again, that
my chance had gone—and I would
have to wait now, anyhow.</p>

<p>And so the time passed. We talked
and talked, while a useful youth who
lived near by, and had attached himself
to my friend Billo, made three reappearances
with hot water for the
cups that cheered as the night went on.</p>

<p>“I wonder where ‘Razzy’ is?”<span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</span>
presently remarked my host; “the jug
wants refilling.”</p>

<p>Just then the disturbing rumble
passed the door again, and I rose to
my feet. “Don’t bother to disturb
him,” I said. “I suppose he’s retired
to his digs. Besides, now’s my chance
to scoot too; I’ve a long way to walk.
Throw me that coat.”</p>

<p>Finding that all protestations were
useless, my friends reluctantly allowed
me to go, but not without wilily expressed
forebodings as to what unpleasantness
might await me outside
now that I had refused to enjoy their
society and comforts any longer.</p>

<p>They accompanied me to the door,
and a cold blast of wind met us. There
were ominous thunder rumbles in the
murky distance.</p>

<p>“A boshter<a id="FNanchor_8" href="#Footnote_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> night for a walk,” I
remarked, buttoning my coat about
me.</p>

<p>“Yes,” grinned my friend, peering
out into the darkness. “And they’re
running to a peculiar sort of time-table
to-night—passing about every seven
minutes. You’d better get a wriggle
on. There’s a short cut that way,” he
added, pointing to the right, “just
past the corner of the cemetery.
That’s where they stop. So for God’s
sake shake it up; if you don’t, they
won’t see you home at all. It’s an
unhealthy night to be out.”</p>

<p>I asked them to say good night to
the youth “Razzy” for me, and to
thank him for his comforting ministration,
then bade them farewell and
moved off.</p>

<p>I blundered along the sloppy, unpaved
footway, peering tensely into
the uncanny blackness about me, and
hurried uneasily in the direction of a
patch of faint pale blotches that I
hoped and took to be the monuments
in the little burying-ground down
beyond. I found that my direction
was right, and presently I was hurrying
past it as fast as I could manage
in the wind and darkness. From somewhere
behind me—it sounded miles and
miles away through the noise of the
wind—a faint low moaning sound
reached my ear. I stepped forward
uneasily, but before I had advanced a
yard it had become more prolonged,
and growing ever louder and closer
until I seemed to feel it coming—coming
with tremendous and ever-increasing
speed: a horrible, nerve-shattering,
deafening, wailing shriek.
I stood dazed and paralysed—rooted to
the spot. With a scream of hellish
intensity—it was all within a second,
really—it was on me. There was a
flash of blinding light, then everything
ended so far as I was concerned.</p>

<p>My next interest in life was a feeling
that I had just been hurled up at the
moon, over it, and had descended
slowly, ever so slowly, like a feather,
to earth again. In fact, I wasn’t quite
sure that I was not a feather; and I
opened my eyes carefully and tried
to feel myself. “’Ssh-sh-sh! Don’t
disturb yourself—remain quiet and
comfy,” said a persuasive voice beside
me. I looked around as far as I could
move, and knew that I was in a hospital,
but where or of what kind I could
not think for the moment. I lay awhile
gazing blankly and unthinkingly at a
low white ceiling above me. Presently
I fell to wondering.</p>

<p>In what suburb, in what town (it
seemed to have been hundreds of years
ago that it had happened), and what
part of Australasia could it be that a
peaceful citizen, walking a darkened
street, homeward bound, could be violently
assailed, near the resting-place
of its harmless sleeping dead, by an
awful uncanny horror descending from
the black unknown? Was I cursed,
haunted, bewitched—or what? Then
there came to me the vague memory of
a friend, one whom I familiarly knew
as “Billo,” and in some way associated
with my terrible, mysterious experience.
But somehow it didn’t seem to
fit in with the slowly gathering evidence
of my returning senses, for it seemed
to me that “Billo” had long before
quitted suburban civilisation for some
great adventure—perhaps—yes, it was
a war somewhere—in which I, too, had
later resolved to follow his example and
do my share. Then how came it that
this terrible experience had befallen me
in the midst of the enjoyment and
comforts of civilisation?</p>

<p>I had a positive though hazy memory
of a comfortable, warm room, pleasant
drinks, cheery conversation; “Billo”
and his companion, the latter a rough,
kindly sort of being—no, it could not
have been a woman; besides, “Billo”
was a bachelor. I remembered that
distinctly.</p>

<p>Suddenly it became clear to me, and
I remembered a silent, rugged man
facetiously dubbed “’Enery” by my
friend—a kindly chap, of very few
words, with whom I had not been long
acquainted. Where had “Billo”
picked him up? There also came
before me the memory of a small,
dilapidated man or youth, dark complexioned;
somehow also attached to
“Billo.” His name was—yes, that
was it.... Who the deuce was
“Razzy”? My mind here became
dazed, and speculation drifted off into
a confusion of reflections: that
“Razzy” was a foreigner of some sort,
living with us under the same conditions,
yet in some way very different
and in a degree inferior; that the hour
at which I left my friend “Billo’s”
home and his inexplicable associates
was quite early in the night—perhaps
only nine-thirty. This latter fact
seemed to linger in my mind, for
presently—with a hazy conviction that
there were sure to be other pedestrians
abroad on a suburban street at that
hour—I heard my own voice asking no
one in particular: “Was there anyone
else there?”</p>

<p>It came as no surprise to hear a
man’s rough voice reply:</p>

<p>“Only a Maltese—at least, we think
he was. He was blown to smithereens.
But don’t let ’em see you talking too
much, mate.”</p>

<p>The room seemed to rock. I opened
my eyes, and with difficulty caught
sight of the speaker. He was in khaki
and wore an A.M.C. badge on his arm.
I was on a hospital ship.</p>

<p>“Then that <em>must</em> have been poor
‘Razzy,’” I muttered at last. Before
my mind’s eye there seemed to unfold
a dissolving scene. The cosy rooms of
my friend “Billo” became a dug-out
in a hillside, lit by a slush lamp made
from bacon fat. “Billo” and his
rugged, silent companion were wearing
the familiar time-tattered uniform that
I knew so well ages and ages ago
(actually it was five days back); the
door through which I had passed into
the unpleasant night was an oilsheet
tied down to keep the weather out; and
the frequent rumbling roar was not
that of a passing suburban train which
I was timing myself to catch. On the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</span>
contrary, it was the <em>intervals</em> between
that sound which interested me. For
each of those rushes past the door of
my friend’s dug-out was a hurtling
Turkish shell, and I wanted to make
my escape at a reasonably safe moment.
Also, the place where “they” chiefly
lobbed was the cemetery at the foot of
the rugged track (I had dreamed of it
as the unpaved footpath of a new
suburb), where rest a score or more
game Australian lads who had taken
part in the landing on Gallipoli. The
unfortunate “Razzy,” by the way, was
but one of a gang of Maltese labourers
brought by the authorities, at a later
and safer period, to help in the landing
of stores from the transports in the bay
at Anzac. He had become friendly
with my luxury-loving friend “Billo,”
and, in gratitude for various kindly
considerations, was willing to provide
the hot water to make our hot-rum
drinks on that memorable night at
“Billo’s” station on our right wing.
(I was quartered miles away on the
extreme left.)</p>

<p>So it was near the cemetery that the
unexpected shell got me; and apparently
“Razzy” also, who was returning
to his camp a hundred yards away.
There seemed something so droll about
the whole strange illusion that, although
in a state of dazed depression,
I might have laughed but for an indescribable
pain in my left side. I saw
that my left arm was supported on
something and lay above the bedclothes
and seemed very heavy.</p>

<p>“Feel comfortable?” said the
A.M.C. man.</p>

<p>“Yes, except for the pain in my left
hand,” I answered.</p>

<p>He looked down, and I followed his
gaze.</p>

<p>“You haven’t got no left hand,” he
said quietly.</p>

<p>I saw that he was right, and this new
illusion struck me as being about the
last straw.</p>

<p>With a dazed sort of conviction I
muttered: “Well, it’s a rummy
world”—and promptly lay back and
drifted out of it for the time being.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="THE_ANZAC_HOMEAND_A">THE ANZAC HOME—AND A
CONTRAST</h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">I am sitting, at the moment of
writing, in a dug-out, one of those
dismal, dark, damp holes cut into
the clay of the Dardanelles, serving
us as a haven of refuge by day
and by night from the ubiquitous
Turkish bullet.</p>

<p>The proportions of this extemporised
dwelling resemble those of an exceedingly
small family tomb—one which
might belong to a family too proud not
to possess a family tomb at all, but too
poor to possess one of adequate size and
comfort (if one can speak of comfort in
such a connection). Its dimensions
should be about ten feet by four, but
I am not enthusiastic enough at the
moment to ascertain them precisely.
Its three walls are of crumbling clay.
Where the fourth wall strictly should
be is an exit which lets in the draught.
Over my head are stretched waterproof
sheets which let in the water. On the
floor, in fine weather, is an inch of
dust, and in bad weather a proportionate
amount of slimy mud. A few
sandbags ranged round the parapet
threaten to tumble in and annihilate my
existence. I am sitting on a roll of bedding.
My haversack, water-bottle, field-glasses,
webbing, pistol, gas helmet,
and india-rubber basin are arranged
round my feet like so many pet dogs
begging for biscuit; and in such an
entourage I think of my room at home—and
that is where this matter of
contrast comes in.</p>

<p>It was the same at dinner. We—that
is to say, my brother officers and
I—sat in another variety of dug-out;
this time an open one—open to all that
blows and falls. Our repast consisted
of an exceedingly stringy rabbit, extracted
from a tin of an ominous purple
hue—an evil-looking dish eked out
with somebody or other’s baked beans,
which are all very well in their way,
but when used as an unvarying vegetable
at all meals begin to pall; bread,
with the crust like a cinder, to which
fondly cling bits of sacking and mules’
whisker; the corpse of a cheese; and
the whole washed down with tea made
in the stew dixie, and tasting more of
dixie and stew than of tea.</p>

<p>As I lean back against the clay wall
of my dug-out, and innumerable particles
of dust cascade down my neck, a
soft reverie steals over my senses. It
seems to me to be about six or seven
o’clock on a murky November afternoon
in London. I have splashed
home from my work in the wind- and
rain-swept streets—the motor-buses
have covered me with black mud—my
umbrella has afforded me the most inadequate
shelter. But these things
seem of little account to me here in
Gallipoli. I see myself reaching my
home in the best of spirits, entering<span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</span>
the hall, and shutting off the outer
darkness. My sense of contrast gives
me a lively notion of dry clothes, of a
comfortable room, of a genial fire, and
of an absorbing book. In future I
shall be grateful for the rain and the
mud and the murky streets for making
these good things seem by contrast so
much more valuable.</p>

<p>Think of it! To sink into a great
arm-chair in front of my library fire,
after a hard and anxious day’s work,
and contemplate the near approach of
an excellent evening meal. How comfortable
and warm and hospitable my
room appears as I lean back and listen
to the rather depressing, smothered
rumble of the traffic in the street
below. Thick curtains hide away the
melancholy November London atmosphere.
Sweet-smelling logs crackle
cheerily on the hearth; a reading-lamp
by my side sheds subdued lustre on the
immediate vicinity of my chair. My
servant glides into the room noiselessly
over the soft carpet, and places the
evening paper by my side. I choose a
cigar from my case, light it, and then
I am perfectly content—and my contentment
is due to contrast between
my content with the existing situation
and my past discontent with other
situations at other times and in other
places.</p>

<p>After a refreshing siesta I go upstairs,
exchange my workaday clothes
for a smoking-suit. Two or three
bachelor friends are due to dine with
me, and by the time I have dressed
and descended again to the sitting-room
they are there ready for my
greeting.</p>

<p>And what a pleasant evening it is
with their company. We talk of old
times, old acquaintances, and old
places. We talk of our big-game
shoots, of our campaigns, and of our
travels, the recollection of which seem
so delightful now that distance lends
enchantment to the view. Dinner is
over; a glass of brandy and old port,
some smokes, and we are just adjourning
to the next room——</p>

<p>“Wake up, old chap—three o’clock.
Your turn for the trenches. It is
snowing hard and the Turks are very
active.”</p>

<p>Contrasts indeed!</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="FLIES_AND_FLEAS">FLIES AND FLEAS</h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">Regarding these two particular
pests, my attitude in
the past has been characterised
by the utmost forbearance; I
tolerated them and looked upon them
as harmless and possibly of some usefulness
to the community. The Gallipoli
specimens, however, have changed my
state of “benevolent neutrality” into
one of most deadly warfare. No
“Hymn of Hate” has yet been composed
which would give expression to
the hatred which has possessed me.</p>

<p>Do you but go into the trenches in
the endeavour to perform your duty to
your country, and the flies immediately
try to dissuade you by getting into
your eyes, ears, nose and mouth.
Nothing will drive them away; they
delight in this; they are entirely without
pity. Retire to your dug-out in
the hope of escaping their attentions,
and they are sure to follow you.
Smoke till you all but asphyxiate yourself,
and you find them as active as
ever. Nothing that human ingenuity
can devise will cause them to retreat;
they defy our puny efforts. You may
imitate the Kaiser and “strafe” them
for all you are worth, but it is only
waste of breath; they glory in this and
come back all the more.</p>

<p>What we frequently distrust in the
way of tucker holds no terrors for the
Gallipoli flies; they delight in taking
risks if only to impress us with their
fearlessness. Stepping boldly on the
edge of a syrup-covered biscuit, they
immediately get their feet entangled;
but they will not retreat—that would
be against all their traditions. Instead,
they will struggle their way towards
the centre, where they gladly give up
the contest and die.</p>

<p>They are born conquerors. I doff
my hat to them in spite of my hate.</p>

<p>With the setting sun the flies retire,
but operations are simply handed over
to their allies, the fleas; and no
worthier ally could be found than
those pilgrims of the night. You may
feel beat to the world, but there is no
rest for you; as soon as you lie down
to enjoy a well-earned rest the attack
commences. Advancing in open or
close formation, according to circumstances,
the enemy attacks on every
flank with fixed bayonets, in the
handling of which his units are experts.
If driven off, they come again
in still greater numbers; they appear
to have unlimited reserves of reinforcements
which can be mobilised on the
shortest notice. Their organisation is
perfect. Counter-attacks in the dark
are all in the favour of the enemy, and
morning finds that they have withdrawn
their forces to advantageous
cover in the blankets, from which it is
impossible to dislodge them. Keating’s
Powder is of no avail against the Gallipoli
fleas; it requires a still higher
explosive to have any effect.</p>

<p>The honours have so far fallen to
the enemy. Personally, I would be inclined
to discuss terms of peace, but I
doubt not he is too depraved to accept
my advances.</p>

</div>

<h3>1.—WALLABY JOE</h3>


<p class="drop-cap">His real name matters little;
suffice it that he was known
among his comrades as “Wallaby
Joe.”</p>

<p>He came to Gallipoli via Egypt with
the Light Horse. Incidentally, he had
ridden nearly a thousand miles over
sun-scorched, drought-stricken plains
to join them.</p>

<p>Age about 38. In appearance the
typical bushman. Tall and lean, but
strong as a piece of hickory. A horseman
from head to toe, and a dead shot.
He possessed the usual bushy beard of
the lonely prospector of the extreme
backblocks. Out of deference to a
delicate hint from his squadron commander
he shaved it off, but resolved to
let it grow again when the exigencies
of active service should discount such
finicking niceties.</p>

<p>His conversation was laconic in the
extreme. When the occasion demanded
it he could swear profusely,
and in a most picturesque vein. When
a bursting shell from a “75” on one
occasion blew away a chunk of prime
Berkshire which he was cooking for
breakfast, his remarks were intensely
original and illuminative.</p>

<p>He could also drink beer for indefinite
periods, but seldom committed
the vulgar error of becoming “tanked.”
Not even that locality “east of Suez,”
where, as the song tells us, “There
ain’t no Ten Commandments and a
man can raise a thirst,” could make his
steps erratic.</p>

<p>He was very shy in the presence of
the softer sex. On one occasion his unwary
footsteps caused him some embarrassment.
Feeling thirsty he turned<span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</span>
into one of those establishments, fairly
common in Cairo, where the southern
proprietors try to hide the villainous
quality of their beer by bribing sundry
young ladies of various nationalities and
colours to give more high-class vaudeville
turns. The aforementioned young
ladies are aided and abetted by a
coloured orchestra, one member of
which manipulates the bagpipes.</p>

<p>A portly damsel had just concluded,
amidst uproarious applause, the haunting
strains of “Ta-ra-ra boom-de-ay.”
She sidled up to Joe with a large-sized
grin on her olive features.</p>

<p>“Gib it kiss,” she murmured, trying
to look ravishing.</p>

<p>But Joe had fled.</p>

<p>Henceforth during his stay in Egypt
he took his beer in a little Russian bar,
the proprietor of which could speak
English, and had been through the
Russo-Japanese War.</p>

<p>When the Light Horse were ordered
at last to the front, Joe took a sad farewell
of his old bay mare. He was, as
a rule, about as sentimental as a steamroller,
but “leaving the old nag behind
hurt some.”</p>

<p>On the Peninsula and under fire his
sterling qualities were not long in coming
to the surface. Living all his life
in an environment in which the pick
and shovel plays an important part he
proved himself an adept at sapping and
mining. At this game he was worth
four ordinary men. No matter how
circuitous the maze of trenches, he
could find his way with ease. He could
turn out all sorts of dishes from his
daily rations of flour, bacon, jam, and
of course the inevitable “bully” and
biscuits. An endless amount of initiative
showed itself in everything he did.
His mates learned quite a lot of things
just by watching him potter about the
trenches and bivouacs. His training at
the military camps of Australia and,
later, in Egypt, combined with the
knowledge he had been imbibing from
Nature all his life, made him an ideal
soldier.</p>

<p>He was used extensively by his
officers as a scout. As the Turkish
trenches were often not more than
twenty yards from our own, needless to
say the scouting was done at night, the
Turks’ favourite time to attack being
just before dawn. Often during these
nocturnal excursions a slight rustle in
the thick scrub would cause his mate
to grasp his rifle with fixed bayonet and
peer into the darkness, with strained
eyes and ears and quickened pulse.</p>

<p>“A hare,” Joe would whisper, and
probably advise him to take things easy
while he himself watched.</p>

<p>This went on for some time until
one night his mate came in alone,
pale-faced and wild-eyed. Interrogated
by the officer on duty, he informed him
that Joe had been shot.</p>

<p>We brought the body in. He had
been shot through the heart—a typical
affair of outposts.</p>

<p>Tucked away in one of the innumerable
gullies, a little grave, one among
hundreds, contains the body of one of
Nature’s grand men. On the wooden
cross surmounting it is the following:</p>

<h3>2.—THE DAG</h3>

<p class="drop-cap">Yes; ’Enessy was a dag if ever
there was one! I remember
the day ’e came into camp at
Liverpool ’e was wearin’ ’is
best Sunday grin, and when some
bloke wot was in the mob yelled out
“Marmalade,” ’e turns round and says
to ’im: “Wot’s your complaint,
mate?” The bloke ’e repeats “Marmalade.”
And ’Enessy says: “Ah!
That’s wot I thought it was. You’d
better see a doctor, and ’ave it operated
on right away, me man!”</p>

<p>’E could eat like a ’orse. Blime!
The way ’e used ter stoke up on ther
bread and jam was a treat for sore eyes.
’E always used ter ask to be put on the
job of picket round the quartermaster’s
store, and they never tumbled to ’is
game for a long while. ’E used ter
watch ’is chance, and every night would
slip in and pinch a loaf of bread and a
tin of jam, and as ’is job consisted of
keeping the cook’s fire a-going all
night, ’e always ’ad a cup of coffee
ready when ’e wanted it. One night ’e
nips into the store to git ’is usual bit of
supper, and ’e bangs right into the
bloke wot was just put in new at the
Q.M. that day.</p>

<p>“Wot are you doin’ ’ere?” asks the
bloke.</p>

<p>“Blime! I thought I ’ad a fair
cop,” says ’Enessy, quick as lightning.
“I ’eard someone moving about in
’ere, and thought it was a chap pinchin’
stuff.”</p>

<p>“And who are you?” says the
bloke.</p>

<p>“Me! I’m the bloomin’ picket,”
says ’Enessy.</p>

<p>“Oh! Alright, picket,” replies the
bloke. “I sleep in here, so you
needn’t worry about the store while
I’m here.”</p>

<p>“Alright, mate!” says ’Enessy.
“Can yer give us a bit of grub? Fair
dinkum, I’m ’ungry!”</p>

<p>So ’e gets ’is grub after all, but ’e
couldn’t come the double no more after
that.</p>

<p>When ’e came over the water and
first sees the Turkish trenches, ’e says:
“Strike me pink! But where’s them
Turks they talk about?”</p>

<p>Says I: “They’re right there behind
them sandbags, old cock! And don’t
you forget it, neither!”</p>

<p>“And don’t they come out and
show themselves?” ’e asks.</p>

<p>“Wot for?” says I.</p>

<p>“Why, for us blokes to shoot at, of
course!” ’e says.</p>

<p>One mornin’ early while we was
standin’ to arms ’e lights up a bumper,
so I tells ’im not to let the officer cop
’im or there’d be trouble. Just then
along comes the bloomin’ officer, so
’Enessy sticks ’is lighted bumper down
south into ’is overcoat pocket, and ’olds
it there out of sight. The officer sniffs
about a bit, then ’e asks ’Enessy:
“Are you smoking?”</p>

<p>“No, sir!” says ’Enessy.</p>

<p>“Well, I can smell smoke!” says
the officer. Then ’e looks pretty ’ard
at ’Enessy and says: “What’s your
name?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</span></p>

<p>“’Enessy, sir.”</p>

<p>“Well, Henessy, your pocket’s on
fire!”</p>

<p>’Enessy looks, and hang me if that
bloomin’ cigarette ’adn’t set fire to ’is
coat pocket. But the officer only
says: “Don’t do it again!” and
whips off.</p>

<p>It was when we came out of the firin’-line
for a week’s spell that ’Enessy
met ’is Waterloo. ’E was detailed for
guard down at the drinkin’ water, and
’e was to take all his nap and camp
down there. The first night, when ’e
was doin’ ’is shift ’e sees a dark shape
movin’ along and challenged it three
times, but never gets no answer. So
’e ups with ’is gun and lets fly.
When the corporal rushes along to
know what the blazes was the matter,
’Enessy ups and tells ’im, so they goes
forward together pretty careful, and
soon they sees a black heap lyin’ on the
sand ahead of them. Gor blime! If
’Enessy ’adn’t gone and shot one of
them poor little Indian donkeys which
’ad strayed along the beach. Well, ’e
was chaffed pretty considerable by ’is
cobbers,<a id="FNanchor_9" href="#Footnote_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> and got fairly sick of hearin’
about it.</p>

<p>Next night when ’e was doin’ ’is shift
again, ’e sees another black shape
movin’ along the beach, so thinkin’ ’is
cobbers were ’avin’ a joke with ’im, ’e
picks up a big stick and goes forward
with it. ’E ’ad gone about twenty
yards, when suddenly there was a flash
and a report, and ’Enessy drops down
with a bullet through ’is chest. Strike
me pink! A real Abdul ’ad come up
this time, and it wasn’t no bloomin’
donkey, neither! ’Enessy was ’it
pretty bad, but ’e grabs ’is rifle and lets
fly, and one more bloomin’ Abdul ’ad
gone to join ’is Prophet. Next day
’Enessy was taken away on a ’ospital
ship, but that was near three months
ago. I ’ear that the blighter is back on
the beach now, and you will be able to
see him yourself when ’e comes back to
the squadron. But strike me! ’E’s a
bloomin’ dag!</p>

<h3>3.—BOBBIE OF THE NEW ARMY</h3>

<p class="drop-cap">Bobbie’s gone sick.</p>

<p>This probably doesn’t interest
you. But, oh, how <em>we</em> miss him.</p>

<p>So we must tell somebody.</p>

<p>Bobbie, the ever-smiling embodiment
of breezy youth; the spirit of
cheerfulness; the Beau Brummell of
the trenches.</p>

<p>Bobbie landed with the regiment,
and went through thick and thin with
it. But always with a smile and never
a scratch. Bullets flew off Bobbie at a
tangent.</p>

<p>Of our officers, three only of the
original arrivals were left when Bobbie
went. He had watched the others go
away one by one, some wounded, some
sick, and some—well, just left,</p>

<div class="poetry-container fs90">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Where the foe and the stranger will tread o’er their heads</div>
    <div class="verse indent1">When we’re far away on the billow.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Bobbie had grown quite proud of his
staying powers, which carried him
through three months of real hardship
and trying work night and day. But
for Bobbie’s smile in adversity and his
way—for he has a way with him—many
of his brave boys would have given up.
But Bobbie’s bright example spurred
them on and they “stuck it,” like their
idol.</p>

<p>Bobbie’s only a youngster, but he is
made of the real “stuff that’s bred in
the army.” When he found himself
exalted to the command of a company
his head didn’t swell. The added responsibilities
were not too heavy for
Bobbie’s shoulders, which really were
not broad relatively when compared
with his broad smile. Bobbie acted like
a tonic to a man run-down.</p>

<p>But, at last, Nature (in collusion with
the M.O.) asserted her imperious will,
and Bobbie just had to go to hospital.
So Bobbie bowed to the inevitable, and,
still smiling, went away.</p>

<p>Bobbie in hospital! What a picture!
His bright smile, his rosy cheeks, and
his immaculately parted hair, framed in
snowy-white pillows. Bobbie—the irresistible!</p>

<p>Bobbie, we were loath to lose you;
Bobbie, we miss you; but, Bobbie,
won’t there be a weeping and a
wailing when the nurses have to let
you go?</p>

<p>Still, “it’s an ill wind that blows
nobody good.” Bobbie’s chocolate
sweetened the bitterness of parting;
Bobbie’s tinned fruit sustains us in his
absence; Bobbie’s cigarettes sooth our
sorrow.</p>

</div>


<p class="drop-cap">My work in the A.S.C. has
brought me very much in
touch with the Indian Mule
Corps; and I don’t think
“The Anzac Book” would be complete
without some mention of that
admirable body of men.</p>

<p>What should we at Anzac have done
without “Johnnie” and his sturdy
little mules? Horse or motor transport
could not have faced the difficulties
of Anzac. The mules are sometimes
stubborn and unmanageable, but we
knew that before. And the drivers are—most
of them—hard workers, intelligent
and anxious to please. I often
marvel on a rough day, when the loaded
carts, nearly up to their axles in mud
or sand, are beached on that wild seashore,
on the watery edge of which they
are kept during the day; and wonder
still more when, after standing there
for a few hours, the mules draw them
out when the convoy leaves at night.
For the mules do not like the sea, and
when the weather is rough it is very
difficult to get the little beasts anywhere
near it.</p>

<p>One thing, however, really does hang
up work for a time, and that is
“Beachy Bill” in action. Even then
some of the “Johnnies,” who are less
fearsome than the rest, go on with their
work, and have from time to time been
hit.</p>

<p>Therefore, all praise to the Indian
Mule Corps.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="JENNY">JENNY</h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">For the delightful diversion
which little Jenny, with her
frolics and gambols, provided for
the A.S.C.’s when they really
had a moment to spare another medium
will have to be sought. Though of
short duration, her life appeared a
charmed one whilst it lasted. Her freedom
of action was the envy of every
soldier along the beach. Her disregard
for the enemy’s bullets and shells commanded
our unbounded admiration.
But whether her immunity for six
months was due to the kindness of
the Turks or their bad shooting, or
her own good judgment, who can
say?</p>

<p>Jenny’s origin is enveloped in some
obscurity; but it is said that with her
parents, Murphy of Red Cross fame
and Jenny Senior, she toddled into our
lines when quite a mite; and, once having
crossed over the border into civilisation,
the three emphatically refused
to return whilst the objectionable
Hun element obtained in their native
country.<a id="FNanchor_10" href="#Footnote_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a></p>

<p>Jenny the younger was no mere
mystic mascot for the humouring of
an especially created superstition. Her
congenial company and high spirits, her
affectionate ways and equable temperament,
were the factors which gained for
her the obvious rank of “Camp Pet.”
Her friendly regular visits will be
missed, and the picture of her patrician
head and dark-brown shaggy winter’s
coat. Her refined voice was music compared
with the common “hee-haw”
which characterises her kind, or the
peremptory foghorn of the sergeant-major.</p>

<p>But now she is no more. Our sorrow
is immeasurable. The mother never left
the babe whilst it suffered excruciating
agony through a deadly shrapnel pellet.
Skilful, indefatigable attention, innumerable
applications of the “invincible
iodine,” proved futile. Jenny
Senior is grief-stricken, and now lies
upon the neat little grave in which her
infant was placed by the big Australian
playmates who now mourn their irreparable
loss.</p>

cross between his two long ears, is said (in company with his master, Pte. Simpson, 3rd Australian Field Ambulance)
to have carried 72 wounded men from the firing line through Shrapnel Gully, at the time when that valley
thoroughly earned its name, before his master met his death on one of these errands of mercy. Murphy himself
was subsequently hit by a shell, but happily survives, and was, we believe, brought safely away from Anzac.—<span class="smcap">Eds.</span></p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="FURPHY">FURPHY</h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">It was the colonel who propounded
the theory first, on hearing some
rumour more optimistic than reliable.
“These furphies<a id="FNanchor_11" href="#Footnote_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a> are the
very devil,” he said.</p>

<p>Now, I had a theory about Furphy.
I was waiting for an opportunity of
following it up, and it came this way:</p>

<p>I was on the beach one day when
a friend met me and asked if I had
heard the latest dinkum. On learning
that I hadn’t, he informed me that
Greece had declared war on Turkey,
and was going to land 100,000 men
within the next few days on the
Peninsula. I inquired for the source,
and he said he got it from a fellow
who had just gone along the beach
towards the left. I asked what the
man was like. That sort of puzzled
him. He said he was a tall man—no,
he thought he was only middle height
or perhaps a bit on the small side. His
hair was dark—no, now that he thought
a bit, he fancied it was fair. In fact,
the more he tried to describe him the
less could he remember him. “He’s
my Moses,” I said, and hurried off in
in the direction he had gone.</p>

<p>Passing through the sap to Shrapnel
Gully, I met another friend.</p>

<p>“Heard the latest?” he inquired.</p>

<p>I said “No.”</p>

<p>“Four Italian staff officers seen on
the beach to-day,” he said breathlessly.
“Two hundred thousand Italian troops
being sent here.”</p>

<p>“Who told you?” I asked.</p>

<p>“Fellow just going into White’s
Valley.”</p>

<p>“What was he like?” I inquired
excitedly.</p>

<p>“An ordinary fellow—not tall, and
not short.”</p>

<p>“His hair?”</p>

<p>“Well, it wasn’t dark—yes, it was—no,
I don’t know.”</p>

<p>“How did he walk?”</p>

<p>“I never noticed,” he said; “in
fact, he didn’t seem to walk at all.”</p>

<p>I left him standing, and got down
the sap and over into White’s Valley
in a record time, and bumped into
another acquaintance.</p>

<p>“Heard the news?” he said.</p>

<p>“No.”</p>

<p>“Why, three hundred thousand
Italians have landed at Helles, and
Achi Baba is to be taken to-night.”</p>

<p>I asked who his informant was, and
he began to flounder into contradictions.
I rushed off, knowing that I
was well on the track of Furphy.</p>

<p>In Victoria Gully I heard that
Roumania had declared war, and
400,000 troops were marching through
Bulgaria to Constantinople.</p>

<p>“Who told you? What was he
like?” I gasped at the teller.</p>

<p>“Just a bloke,” was the answer.
“’E ’ad two legs, two arms, and a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</span>
’ead, two eyes——” Then he added in
a puzzled fashion: “But, dammit,
did ’e?”</p>

<p>I didn’t wait any longer, but was off
again. At Shell Green I heard that a
man—just a feller, rather—had told
them that the Russians had surrounded
and captured Hindenburg’s army, and
that 500,000 Russians were to make
a landing in Turkey. The Russian
officers were here already. The man
who had seen them had just passed five
minutes before. I wasn’t far from
Furphy now.</p>

<p>At Chatham’s Post they were buzzing
with excitement over the news that
600,000 French were going to be
landed between Kaba Tepe and Helles.</p>

<p>I asked if they thought it was true,
and they assured me that they had
heard it from a man who looked as if
he knew. No two descriptions of him,
however, agreed. I was getting closer
to Furphy.</p>

<p>I hurried along the trenches as fast
as I could, but got no information till
near Lone Pine, where I heard that a
big mob of Turks was expected to
surrender that night. It was said they
could not face the prospect of the
coming landing of the whole Italian
army. Besides, they were short of
food and water, they were being badly
treated by their officers, and their guns
had hardly any ammunition left. A
75 just then knocked a portion of
parapet over me. I remarked that
anyone could see the information was
right about Abdul being short of ammunition,
but where did the information
come from?</p>

<p>“A fellow that just went by,” they
said; “looked like a staff officer.”</p>

<p>Getting near Steele’s Post, I saw in
front of me a man with an indescribable
gait. He seemed to float along
instead of walk. It was Furphy!</p>

<p>I hurried, but seemed to make no
gain on him. I began to run. Near
Courtney’s Post I was twenty yards
from him, and called to a man to stop
him. My quarry brushed past. I put
on a spurt. I was within about five
yards of him when, all of a sudden, he
sank into the earth. As his head disappeared
he smiled an oily grimace at
me.</p>

<p>And I noticed that there were small
horns behind his ears.</p>

<p class="center no-indent">(<em>A Sketch by One who knows him very well</em>)</p>

<p class="drop-cap">In a shady spot beneath the scarlet-blossomed
Judas trees, Abdul sat
sipping his coffee, contemplating
the busy scene in the small marketplace.
There were happy fishermen
hanging their nets to dry on the lime
trees for which the village is famous,
after their night’s toil in the Black Sea.
Their catch was a good one, and was
even now being put up for sale in the
narrow alleys by the Jews. The village
barber was a hard-worked man that
day, for the Turk is vain and also dignified,
and was it not the eve of the
Bairam festival! Groups of gaily
coloured villagers among the fruiterers’
baskets were busy haggling over their
bargains. The word “Cauzaum” (my
lamb) would often be flung by an infuriated
vendor at stalwart Kurds,
workers in the neighbouring quarry,
who fingered his luscious grapes whilst
cavilling at his prices. From a latticed
window a veiled woman with a shrill
voice called to a little red-fezzed boy
escaping from his mother.</p>

<p>The <em>Mouktar</em> (mayor), with a jasper-handled
stick, was pointing to the new
fountain, its gilded inscription of extracts
from the Koran shining in the
sun. Had not the <em>Mouktar</em> sat day
after day outside the door of the great
<em>Dahlié Naziri</em> (Minister of Interior)
waiting to obtain a credit for the construction
of the fountain whose waters
were from the Beicos bends?</p>

<p>“God is great, and Mahomet is His
prophet,” murmured Abdul, as he
slowly counted off another bead from
his amber rosary. “I am a happy
man,” he murmured to himself. “Was
not my Kismet good; when lifting the
veil of my wife at the marriage ceremony
I found that she was beautiful?
She is a good housekeeper; her coffee
resembles that of the creamy Arabian
coffee bean. Is not the gilled ram that
I bought for to-morrow’s sacrifice
worthy of her cooking?”</p>

<p>Abdul wandered along homewards to
his cottage near the shore; for it was
drawing close to the midday call to
prayer, and his heart was full of thanksgiving
to Allah.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>Abdul is struggling along the main
road leading to Stamboul with many
others. He no longer hearkens to the
beating of the tom-toms, and to the
patriotic exhortations of a straggling
mob following behind with green banners.
“It is Kismet,” he murmurs, as
he turns once more for a last look at the
silvery winding thread below—the Bosphorus,
on whose shores lies his home,
his all. He has been told there is a
war. He does not question; he knows<span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</span>
not the cause. It is fate. He trudges
on.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>The fighting has been fierce. He is
hard pressed. Sweating with blood he
draws back. His regiment is hard put
to it, and, like sheep without a master,
the men are preparing to disperse.
Already German machine-guns from
their rear are on to them. The road
home means death. Like a man he
faces the rush of his opponents.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>He sees strange faces—the pain from
his wounds is calmed. Once more there
swim before his eyes his home, his wife,
his plantation of maize so promising.</p>

<p>Allah was great—it was Kismet.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="ARMY_BISCUITS">ARMY BISCUITS</h2>
</div>


<p class="drop-cap">Biscuits! Army biscuits!
What a volume of blessings and
cursings have been uttered on
the subject of biscuits—army
biscuits!</p>

<p>What a part they take in our daily
routine: the carrying of them, the eating
of them, the cursing at them!</p>

<p>Could we find any substitute for biscuits?
Surely not! It is easy to think
of biscuits without an army, but of an
army without biscuits—never.</p>

<p>Biscuits, like the poor, are always
with us. Crawling from our earthly
dens at the dim dawning of the day,
we receive no portion of the dainties
which once were ours in the long ago
times of effete civilisation; but, instead,
we devour with eagerness—biscuit porridge.
We eat our meat, not with
thankfulness, but with biscuits. We
lengthen out the taste of jam—with
biscuits. We pound them to powder.
We boil them with bully. We stew
them in stews. We fry them as
fritters. We curse them with many
and bitter cursings, and we bless them
with few blessings.</p>

<p>Biscuits! Army biscuits! Consider
the hardness of them. Remember the
cracking of your plate, the breaking
of this tooth, the splintering of that.
Call to mind how your finest gold
crown weakened, wobbled, and finally
shrivelled under the terrific strain of
masticating Puntley and Chalmer’s
No. 5’s.</p>

<p>Think of the aching void where once
grew a goodly tooth. Think of the
struggle and strain, the crushing and
crunching as two molars wrestled with
some rocky fragment. Think of the
momentary elation during the fleeting
seconds when it seemed that the molars
would triumphantly blast and scrunch
through every stratum of the thrice-hardened
rock. Call to mind the disappointment,
the agony of mind and
body, as the almost victorious grinder
missed its footing, slipped, and snapped
hard upon its mate, while the elusive
biscuit rasped and scraped upon bruised
and tender gums.</p>

<p>Biscuits! Army biscuits! Have you,
reader, ever analysed with due carefulness
the taste of army biscuits? Is it
the delicious succulency of ground
granite or the savoury toothsomeness
of powdered marble? Do we perceive
a delicate flavouring of ferro-concrete<span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</span>
with just a dash of scraped iron railings?
Certainly, army biscuits, if they
have a taste, have one which is peculiarly
their own. The choicest dishes
of civilised life, whether they be baked
or boiled, stewed or steamed, fried,
frizzled, roasted or toasted, whether
they be composed of meat or fish, fruit
or vegetable, have not (thank Heaven!)
any like taste to that of army biscuits.
Army biscuits taste like nothing else
on the Gallipoli Peninsula. It is a
debatable question indeed whether or
not they have the quality of taste. If
it be granted that they possess this
faculty of stimulating the peripheral
extremities of a soldier’s taste-buds,
then it must also be conceded that
the stimulation is on the whole of an
unpleasant sort. In short, that the
soldier’s feeling, apart from the joy,
the pride, and the satisfaction at his
completed achievement in transferring
a whole biscuit from his outer to his
inner man without undue accident or
loss of teeth, is one of pain, unease,
and dissatisfaction.</p>

<p>It may seem almost incredible,
wholly unbelievable indeed, but armies
have marched and fought, made sieges,
retired according to plan, stormed impregnable
cities, toiled in weariness and
painfulness, kept lonely vigils, suffered
the extremes of burning heat and of
freezing cold, and have, in the last
extremity, bled and died, laurel-crowned
and greatly triumphant, the
heroes of legend and of song, all without
the moral or physical, or even
spiritual aid of army biscuits.</p>

<p>Agamemnon and the Greeks camped
for ten years on the windy plains
of Troy without one box of army
biscuits. When Xerxes threw his pontoon
bridge across the Narrows and
marched 1,000,000 men into Greece,
his transport included none of Teak
Green and Co.’s paving-stones for the
hardening of his soldiers’ hearts and
the stiffening of their backs. Cæsar
subdued Britons, Gauls, and Germans.
Before the lines of Dyrrhachium his
legions lived many days on boiled grass
and such-like delicacies, but they never
exercised their jaws upon a rough,
tough bit of—army biscuit.</p>

<p>Biscuits! Army biscuits! They are
old friends now, and, like all old
friends, they will stand much hard wear
and tear. Well glazed, they would
make excellent tiles or fine flagstones.
After the war they will have great
scarcity value as curios, as souvenirs
which one can pass on from generation
to generation, souvenirs which will
endure while the Empire stands. If
we cannot get physical strength from
army biscuits, let us at least catch the
great spiritual ideal of enduring hardness,
which they are so magnificently
fitted to proclaim.</p>

<p>The seasons change. Antwerp falls,
Louvain is burned, the tide of battle
surges back and forth; new reputations
are made, the old ones pass away;
Warsaw, Lemberg, Servia, the stern
battle lines of Gallipoli, Hindenburg,
Mackensen, each name catches our ear
for brief moments of time, and then
gives way to another crowding it out;
but army biscuits are abiding facts,
always with us, patient, appealing,
enduring. We can move to other
theatres, we can change our clothes,
our arms, and our generals, but we
must have our biscuits, army biscuits,
else we are no longer an army.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="THE_LOST_POEM">THE LOST POEM</h2>
</div>


<p class="drop-cap">I called to see our regimental
poet last evening. He had previously
told me that he intended
to “write something” for “The
Anzac Book.” Our poet is also
Q.M. Sergeant, and when he is not
writing requisitions or taking “baksheesh”
out of our rations, and watering
our rum, he writes poetry.</p>

<p>When I called on him he was in his
dug-out, surrounded by bully-beef tins,
empty cases, and his ill-gotten shares
of our daily issues. He has many
callers, and I am afraid their inquiries
rather spoilt his verses. When I
arrived the Q.M.S. was already in a
poor humour for writing poetry. The
O.C. had been worrying him about
galvanised iron for cover for some dug-outs;
three men had complained about
the scantiness of their rum issue—which
somehow always annoys the Q.M.S.;
and he had received no letters in the
day’s mail except a bill from a chap he
had borrowed a pound from in Charleville
two years ago. Still, our Q.M.S.
is a sticker, and he read me the covering
letter which he was sending to the
Editor.</p>

<p>He said he thought it would be
as well to get the letter off his mind
first. That would make the writing of
the verses necessary, and he would have
to complete the job in order to keep
faith.</p>

<p>Before I arrived he had written:</p>

<div class="blockquot fs90">

<p>Yes, Mr. Editor, I will try to “write something”
for your book. ’Tis a glorious
day, bright with sunshine, and the snow has
melted away from the sides of the hills—snow
that so many Anzacites saw fall for the first
time. I know a state where no snow falls.
And, to-night, being rum issue night, I would
sing to you of black soil plains and wheat-fields,
of warm comfy boundary riders’ huts, and of
holidays where plump maids join you in surf-bathing
excursions. But you see I am a Q.M.S.,
and at other times when I have tried to versify
I have been disturbed. We have a Quartermaster,
but, of course, I do all the work. Well,
let’s rhyme. Boy, bring me the lyre. The
Quartermaster? No, I don’t want the Quartermaster.
I want a harp that I may sing to my
muse....</p>
</div>

<p>He had just read this much out when
the sergeant came in and reported that
the C.O. insisted on the galvanised iron
being procured to-morrow. Then a
corporal called and wanted to know
could six men in his section have new
boots, and when would the rubber boots
be ready for the coves in the trenches?</p>

<p>“How can a man write when he is
interrupted like this?” asked our poet.
“I had a lovely inspiration, too, about
surf bathing. It ran like this——”</p>

<p>But again there was an interruption.
The sergeant cook was the caller, and
he was angry and hostile. “How the —— can<span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</span>
I cook seventy beef teas,
forty puddings and two hundred milk
diets with the bloomin’ quarter issue of
water I get? Love me, when I was
cooking for shearing sheds out on the
Barcoo, where it never rained, I could
get as much water as I wanted. If you
want them bloomin’ milk diets you
got to get me water—or cook them
yourself.”</p>

<p>I don’t know whether our poet had
a rod with which he taps the rock and
brings forth water, but he mollified the
sergeant cook by getting water from
somewhere. It tasted well in the rum,
too. I would have heard the first line
of the poem if one of the sergeants in
our hospital had not called down for
three hot-water bottles, a tin of Bovril,
and some brandy for a sick soldier. I
wonder how sick you have to be before
you get brandy? Before the sergeant
had gone the orderly officer came in.
He bullied the Q.M.S. about not getting
some tents repaired.</p>

<p>“It’s hard work trying to write a
poem here,” said the Q.M.S. sadly,
when the orderly officer departed.
“For two pins I’d chuck writin’, but
that idea about the surf girls is too good
to lose. I was going to start with this
line——”</p>

<p>“Those patients up in Number Three
Ward must have more blankets. And
you will have to get another forty beds
ready to-night,” yelled a voice at the
door.</p>

<p>“Excuse me a bit,” said the poet.
He was gone about an hour. When he
returned there were five men waiting
to interview him. The corporal wished
that the Q.M.S. would explain how
men were to keep their boots on without
laces, and whether socks were supposed
to be everlasting. The second
caller came on a more peaceful mission.
He simply wished to know if the
Q.M.S. had heard anything about a
consignment of Christmas billy-cans
that good people in Australia are supposed
to be sending us. I don’t know
why, but this query made my friend
very angry. “Do you think I’ve got
your bloomin’ billy-cans?” he yelled.
Why should a Q.M.S. say a thing like
that? And he seemed so indignant
about it, too. The third chap wanted
some paper and an envelope to write
to his girl; the fourth wanted an old
blanket and some twine to make a
shroud for a man who had died; and
the fifth asked whether the Q.M.S.
knew what was the latest war news.
When he was told to go to a place
warmer than Port Darwin, he asked
quietly if either of us could tell him if
sheep would do well around Adrianople
after the war.</p>

<p>It was growing late, but I thought
I would wait a bit and hear that first
line about the surf bathers. Two men
came in for soap; a doctor chap called
to ask whether there was any fruit to
make a fruit salad for a sick man; a
lance-corporal said his boots hurt, and
got a bigger pair; the cook came back
and complained that somebody had
pinched six tins of condensed milk; and
an officer’s servant inquired whether
his boss could have an old box and a
ground-sheet to make a bath.</p>

<p>Then the Q.M.S. had another rum
and took up his pencil again. He
spread out a piece of paper and commenced
to write. “I’ll get that first
verse off and read it to you,” he said.
He would have done it, too, but for
the sergeant-major. Our sergeant-major
is a—well, he is just a sergeant-major,
and he does not write verse.</p>

<p>“What about those great-coats?”
he roared. “Didn’t I tell you to get
them to-day? And they are not here.
Weeks ago I ordered you to get them.
I don’t suppose you ever requisitioned
for them. What’s that you’re writing
now—requisitions?”</p>

<p>“No, sir,” said the Q.M.S. “It’s
a poem.”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="THE_STORY_OF_ANZAC">THE STORY OF ANZAC</h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">The following extracts from the
dispatches of Sir Ian Hamilton
form a short official summary of the
history of Anzac:</p>

<div class="sidenotel">The Landing</div>

<p>The Australian and New Zealand Army Corps
sailed out of Mudros Bay on the afternoon
of April 24, escorted by the
2nd Squadron of the Fleet,
under Rear-Admiral Thursby.
The rendezvous was reached just after half-past
one in the morning of the 25th, and there the
1,500 men who had been placed on board H.M.
ships before leaving Mudros were transferred
to their boats. This operation was carried out
with remarkable expedition and in absolute
silence. Simultaneously the remaining 2,500
men of the covering force were transferred
from their transports to six destroyers. At
2.30 <span class="allsmcap">A.M.</span> H.M. ships, together with the tows
and the destroyers, proceeded to within some
four miles of the coast, H.M.S. <em>Queen</em> (flying
Rear-Admiral Thursby’s flag) directing on a
point about a mile north of Kaba Tepe. At
3.30 <span class="allsmcap">A.M.</span> orders to go ahead and land were
given to the tows, and at 4.10 <span class="allsmcap">A.M.</span> the destroyers
were ordered to follow.</p>

<p>All these arrangements worked without a
hitch, and were carried out in complete orderliness
and silence. No breath of wind ruffled
the surface of the sea, and every condition was
favourable save for the moon which, sinking
behind the ships, may have silhouetted them
against its orb, betraying them thus to watchers
on the shore.</p>

<p>A rugged and difficult part of the coast had
been selected for the landing, so difficult and
rugged that I considered the Turks were not
at all likely to anticipate such a descent. Indeed,
owing to the tows having failed to maintain
their exact direction, the actual point of
disembarkation was rather more than a mile
north of that which I had selected, and was
more closely overhung by steeper cliffs. Although
this accident increased the initial difficulty
of driving the enemy off the heights inland,
it has since proved itself to have been a blessing
in disguise, inasmuch as the actual base of
the force of occupation has been much better
defiladed from shell fire.</p>

<p>The beach on which the landing was actually
effected is a very narrow strip of sand, about
1,000 yards in length, bounded on the north
and the south by two small promontories. At
its southern extremity a deep ravine, with exceedingly
steep, scrub-clad sides, runs inland
in a north-easterly direction. Near the northern
end of the beach a small but steep gully runs
up into the hills at right angles to the shore.
Between the ravine and the gully the whole
of the beach is backed by the seaward face
of the spur, which forms the north-western
side of the ravine. From the top of the spur
the ground falls almost sheer except near the
southern limit of the beach, where gentler
slopes give access to the mouth of the ravine
behind. Further inland lie in a tangled knot
the under-features of Sari Bair, separated by
deep ravines, which take a most confusing diversity
of direction. Sharp spurs, covered with
dense scrub, and falling away in many places
in precipitous sandy cliffs, radiate from the
principal mass of the mountain, from which they
run north-west, west, south-west, and south to
the coast.</p>

<p>The boats approached the land in the silence<span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</span>
and the darkness, and they were close to the
shore before the enemy stirred. Then about
one battalion of Turks was seen running
along the beach. At this critical moment the
conduct of all ranks was most praiseworthy.
Not a word was spoken—everyone remained
perfectly orderly and quiet awaiting the enemy’s
fire, which sure enough opened, causing many
casualties. The moment the boats touched
land the Australians’ turn had come. Like
lightning they leapt ashore, and each man as
he did so went straight as his bayonet at the
enemy. So vigorous was the onslaught that
the Turks made no attempt to withstand it and
fled from ridge to ridge pursued by the Australian
infantry.</p>

<p>This attack was carried out by the 3rd Australian
Brigade, under Major (temporary
Colonel) Sinclair Maclagan, D.S.O. The 1st
and 2nd Brigades followed promptly, and were
all disembarked by 2 <span class="allsmcap">P.M.</span>, by which time 12,000
men and two batteries of Indian Mountain
Artillery had been landed. The disembarkation
of further artillery was delayed owing
to the fact that the enemy’s heavy guns opened
on the anchorage and forced the transports,
which had been subjected to continuous shelling
from his field guns, to stand farther out to sea.</p>

<p>The broken ground, the thick scrub, the
necessity for sending any formed detachments
post haste as they landed to the critical point—all
these led to confusion and mixing up of
units. Eventually the mixed crowd of fighting
men, some advancing from the beach, others
falling back before the oncoming Turkish
supports, solidified into a semi-circular position
with its right about a mile north of Gaba Tepe
and its left on the high ground over Fisherman’s
Hut. During this period parties of the 9th
and 10th Battalions charged and put out of
action three of the enemy’s Krupp guns. During
this period also the disembarkation of the
Australian Division was being followed by that
of the New Zealand and Australian Division
(two brigades only).</p>

<hr class="tb">

<div class="sidenote">The Counter-Attack</div>

<p>From 11 <span class="allsmcap">A.M.</span> to 3 <span class="allsmcap">P.M.</span> the enemy, now
reinforced to a strength of 20,000 men, attacked
the whole line, making a specially strong
effort against the 3rd Brigade and the left
of the 2nd Brigade. This counter-attack was,
however, handsomely repulsed with the help
of the guns of H.M. ships. Between 5 and 6.30
<span class="allsmcap">P.M.</span> a third most determined
counter-attack was made
against the 3rd Brigade, who
held their ground with more than equivalent
stubbornness. During the night again the Turks
made constant attacks; but in spite of all
the line held firm. The troops had had practically
no rest on the night of the 24-25th;
they had been fighting hard all day over most
difficult country, and they had been subjected
to heavy shrapnel fire in the open. Their
casualties had been deplorably heavy. But,
despite their losses and in spite of their fatigue,
the morning of the 26th found them still in good
heart and as full of fight as ever.</p>

<p>It is a consolation to know that the Turks
suffered still more seriously. Several times our
machine guns got on to them in close formation,
and the whole surrounding country is still
strewn with their dead of this date.</p>

<p>The reorganisation of units and formations
was impossible during the 26th and 27th owing
to persistent attacks. An advance was impossible
until a reorganisation could be effected,
and it only remained to entrench the position
gained and to perfect the arrangements for
bringing up ammunition, water and supplies
to the ridges—in itself a most difficult undertaking.
Four battalions of the Royal Naval
Division were sent up to reinforce the Army
Corps on April 28 and 29.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<div class="sidenote">May 2</div>

<p>On the night of May 2, a bold effort was
made to seize a commanding knoll in front of
the centre of the line. The
enemy’s enfilading machine
guns were too scientifically
posted, and 800 men were lost without advantage
beyond the infliction of a corresponding
loss to the enemy. On May 4, an attempt to
seize Kaba Tepe was also unsuccessful, the
barbed-wire here being something beyond
belief. But a number of minor operations
were carried out, such as the taking of a
Turkish observing station, the strengthening
of entrenchments, the reorganisation of units,
and the perfecting of communication with
the landing-place. Also a constant strain
was placed upon some of the best troops<span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</span>
of the enemy, who, to the number of 24,000,
were constantly kept fighting and being killed
and wounded freely, as the Turkish sniper
is no match for the Kangaroo shooter, even
at his own game.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<div class="sidenotel">Two Brigades
sent to Helles</div>

<p>The many urgent calls for reinforcements
made during the previous critical fighting had
forced me to disorganise and
mix together several of the
formations in the southern
group, to the extent even of the French on
our right having a British battalion holding
their own extremest right. For the purposes
of the impending fight, it became therefore
necessary to create temporarily a Composite
Division, consisting of the 2nd Australian and
New Zealand Infantry Brigades (withdrawn
for the purpose from the northern section)
together with a Naval Brigade formed of the
Plymouth and Drake Battalions. The 29th
Division was reconstituted into four brigades,
i.e. the 88th and 87th Brigades, the Lancashire
Fusilier Brigade (T.F.), and the 29th Indian
Infantry Brigade. The French Corps Expéditionnaire
was reinforced by the 2nd Naval
Brigade, and the new Composite Division
formed my General Reserve.</p>

<p>During the three days (May 6/8th) our troops
were destined to be very severely tried. They
were about to attack a series of positions
scientifically selected in advance which, although
not yet joined up into one line of entrenchment,
were already strengthened by works on their
more important tactical features.</p>

<p>[After recounting the heavy fighting by
which the 29th Division made its advance on
May 6 and 7, the dispatch continues:]</p>

<p>The troops were now worn out; the new lines
needed consolidating, and it was certain that
fresh reinforcements were reaching the Turks.
Balancing the actual state of my own troops
against the probable condition of the Turks, I
decided to call upon the men to make one more
push before the new enemy forces could get
into touch with their surroundings.</p>

<p>Orders were therefore issued to dig in at sundown
on the line gained, to maintain that line
against counter-attack, and to prepare to advance
again next morning. The Lancashire
Fusilier Brigade was withdrawn into reserve,
and its place on the left was taken by the
Brigade of New Zealanders.</p>

<p>General Headquarters were shifted to an
entrenchment on a hill in rear of the left of
our line. Under my plan for the fresh attack,
the New Zealand Brigade was to advance
through the line held during the night by the
88th Brigade and press on towards Krithia.
Simultaneously, the 87th Brigade was to
threaten the works on the west of the ravine,
whilst endeavouring, by means of parties of
scouts and volunteers, to steal patches of
ground from the areas dominated by the
German machine-guns.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<div class="sidenote">Battle of
Krithia</div>

<p>At 10.15 <span class="allsmcap">A.M.</span> heavy fire from ships and
batteries was opened on the whole front, and at
10.30 <span class="allsmcap">A.M.</span> the New Zealand
Brigade began to move, meeting
with strenuous opposition
from the enemy, who had received his reinforcements.
Supported by the fire of the batteries
and the machine-guns of the 88th Brigade, they
pushed forward on the right and advanced
their centre beyond the fir trees, but could
make little further progress. By 1.30 <span class="allsmcap">P.M.</span>
about 200 yards had been gained beyond the
previously most advanced trenches of the 88th
Brigade.</p>

<p>At this hour the French Corps reported they
could not advance up the crest of the spur west
of Kereves Dere till further progress was made
by the British.</p>

<p>At 4 <span class="allsmcap">P.M.</span> I gave orders that the whole line,
reinforced by the 2nd Australian Brigade,
would fix bayonets, slope arms, and move on
Krithia precisely at 5.30 <span class="allsmcap">P.M.</span></p>

<p>At 5.15 <span class="allsmcap">P.M.</span> the ships’ guns and our heavy
artillery bombarded the enemy’s position for a
quarter of an hour, and at 5.30 <span class="allsmcap">P.M.</span> the field
guns opened a hot shrapnel fire to cover the
infantry advance.</p>

<p>The co-operation of artillery and infantry in
this attack was perfect, the timing of the
movement being carried out with great precision.
Some of the companies of the New
Zealand regiments did not get their orders in
time, but acting on their own initiative they
pushed on as soon as the heavy howitzers
ceased firing, thus making the whole advance
simultaneous.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</span></p>

<p>The steady advance of the British could be
followed by the sparkle of their bayonets until
the long lines entered the smoke clouds. The
French at first made no move, then, their
drums beating and bugles sounding the charge,
they suddenly darted forward in a swarm of
skirmishers, which seemed in one moment to
cover the whole southern face of the ridge of
the Kereves Dere. Against these the Turkish
gunners now turned their heaviest pieces, and
as the leading groups stormed the first Turkish
redoubt the ink-black bursts of high-explosive
shells blotted out both assailants and assailed.
The trial was too severe for the Senegalese
tirailleurs. They recoiled. They were rallied.
Another rush forward, another repulse, and
then a small supporting column of French
soldiers was seen silhouetted against the sky
as they charged upwards along the crest of the
ridge of the Kereves Dere, whilst elsewhere it
grew so dark that the whole of the battlefield
became a blank.</p>

<p>Not until next morning did any reliable
details come to hand of what had happened.
The New Zealanders’ firing line had marched
over the cunningly concealed enemy’s machine-guns
without seeing them, and these, re-opening
on our supports as they came up, caused
them heavy losses. But the first line pressed
on and arrived within a few yards of the Turkish
trenches which had been holding up our advance
beyond the fir wood. There they dug themselves
in.</p>

<p>The Australian Brigade had advanced through
the Composite Brigade, and, in spite of heavy
losses from shrapnel, machine-gun, and rifle
fire, had progressed from 300 to 400 yards.</p>

<p>The determined valour shown by these two
brigades, the New Zealand Brigade, under
Brigadier-General F. E. Johnston, and the 2nd
Australian Infantry Brigade, under Brigadier-General
the Hon. J. W. McCay, are worthy of
particular praise. Their losses were correspondingly
heavy, but in spite of fierce counter-attacks
by numerous fresh troops they stuck to
what they had won with admirable tenacity.</p>

<p>On the extreme left the 87th Brigade, under
Major-General W. R. Marshall, made a final
and especially gallant effort to advance across
the smooth, bullet-swept area between the
ravine and the sea, but once more the enemy
machine-guns thinned the ranks of the leading
companies of the South Wales Borderers,
and again there was nothing for it but to give
ground. But when night closed in, the men of
the 87th Brigade of their own accord asked to
be led forward, and achieved progress to the
extent of just about 200 yards. During the
darkness the British troops everywhere entrenched
themselves on the line gained. On
the right the French column, last seen as
it grew dark, had stormed and still held the
redoubt round which the fighting had centred.</p>
<br>

<p>[The 2nd Australian Infantry Brigade and
New Zealand Infantry Brigade were for three
days in the trenches they had dug, but on
the completion of the push towards Krithia
were retransferred to Anzac. The history of
Anzac during the next three months is told
in the following extracts:]</p>
<br>

<div class="sidenote">Quinn’s Post</div>

<p>Turning now to where the Australian and
New Zealand Army Corps were perched upon
the cliffs of Sari Bair, I must
begin by explaining that their
rôle at this stage of the
operations was—first, to keep open a door leading
to the vitals of the Turkish position;
secondly, to hold up as large a body as possible
of the enemy in front of them, so as to lessen
the strain at Cape Helles. Anzac, in fact,
was cast to play second fiddle to Cape Helles,
a part out of harmony with the daredevil
spirit animating those warriors from the South,
and so it has come about that, as your Lordship
will now see, the defensive of the Australians
and New Zealanders has always tended to
take on the character of an attack.</p>

<p>The line held during the period under review
by the Australian and New Zealand Army
Corps formed a rough semi-circle inland from
the beach of Anzac Cove, with a diameter of
about 1,100 yards. The firing line is everywhere
close to the enemy’s trenches, and in all
sections of the position sapping, counter-sapping,
and bomb attacks have been incessant.
The shelling both of the trenches and beaches
has been impartial and liberal. As many as
1,400 shells have fallen on Anzac within the
hour, and these of all calibres, from 11 inches
to field shrapnel. Around Quinn’s Post, both
above and below ground, the contest has been<span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</span>
particularly severe. This section of the line
is situated on the circumference of the Anzac
semi-circle at the farthest point from its
diameter. Here our fire trenches are mere
ledges on the brink of a sheer precipice falling
200 feet into the valley below. The enemy’s
trenches are only a few feet distant.</p>

<p>On May 9 a night assault was delivered on
the enemy’s trenches in front of Quinn’s Post.
The trenches were carried at the point of the
bayonet. At dawn on May 10 a strong
counter-attack forced our troops to fall back
on Quinn’s Post.</p>

<p>On the night of May 14-15 a sortie was
made from Quinn’s Post with the object of
filling in Turkish trenches in which bomb-throwers
were active. The sortie, which cost
us some 70 casualties, was not successful.</p>

<p>On May 14, Lieutenant-General Sir W. R.
Birdwood was slightly wounded, but I am
glad to say he was not obliged to relinquish the
command of his corps.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<div class="sidenotel">Death of
Gen. Bridges</div>

<p>On May 15 I deeply regret to say Major-General
W. T. Bridges, commanding the Australian
Division, received a
severe wound, which proved
fatal a few days later. Sincere
and single-minded in his devotion to Australia
and to duty, his loss still stands out even
amidst the hundreds of other brave officers
who have gone.</p>

<p>[General Bridges was succeeded by Major-General
H. B. Walker. The 1st Australian
Division was also commanded by Major-General
J. G. Legge, who afterwards organised and
commanded the 2nd Australian Division.]</p>

<hr class="tb">

<div class="sidenotel">May 19</div>

<p>On May 18 Anzac was subjected to a heavy
bombardment from large calibre guns and
howitzers. At midnight of
the 18th-19th the most violent
rifle and machine-gun
fire yet experienced broke out along the front.
Slackening from 3 <span class="allsmcap">A.M.</span> to 4 <span class="allsmcap">A.M.</span> it then broke
out again, and a heavy Turkish column assaulted
the left of No. 2 section. This assault was
beaten off with loss. Another attack was
delivered before daylight on the centre of this
section; it was repeated four times and repulsed
each time with very serious losses to the
enemy. Simultaneously a heavy attack was
delivered on the north-east salient of No. 4
section, which was repulsed and followed up,
but the pressing of the counter-attack was
prevented by shrapnel. Attacks were also
delivered on Quinn’s Post, Courtney’s Post,
and along the front of our right section. At
about 5 <span class="allsmcap">A.M.</span> the battle was fairly joined, and
a furious cannonade was begun by a large
number of enemy guns, including 12-inch and
9.2-inch, and other artillery that had not till
then opened. By 9.30 <span class="allsmcap">A.M.</span> the Turks were
pressing hard against the left of Courtney’s
and the right of Quinn’s Post. At 10 <span class="allsmcap">A.M.</span>
this attack, unable to face fire from the right,
swung round to the left, where it was severely
handled by our guns and the machine-guns of
our left section. By 11 <span class="allsmcap">A.M.</span> the enemy, who
were crowded together in the trenches beyond
Quinn’s Post, were giving way under their
heavy losses.</p>

<p>According to prisoners’ reports 30,000 troops,
including five fresh regiments, were used against
us. General Liman von Sanders was himself
in command.</p>

<p>The enemy’s casualties were heavy, as may
be judged from the fact that over 3,000 dead
were lying in the open in view of our trenches.
A large proportion of these losses were due to
our artillery fire. Our casualties amounted to
about 100 killed and 500 wounded, including
nine officers wounded.</p>

<p>The next four days were chiefly remarkable
for the carrying through of the negotiations
for the suspension of arms, which actually took
place on May 24. The negotiations resulted
in a suspension of arms from 7.30 <span class="allsmcap">A.M.</span> to
4.30 <span class="allsmcap">P.M.</span> on May 24. The procedure laid
down for this suspension of arms was, I am
glad to inform your Lordship, correctly observed
on both sides.</p>

<p>The burial of the dead was finished about
3 <span class="allsmcap">P.M.</span> Some 3,000 Turkish dead were removed
or buried in the area between the opposing lines.
The whole of these were killed on or since May
18. Many bodies of men killed earlier were
also buried.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<div class="sidenotel">Quinn’s
Again</div>

<p>From May 28 till June 5 the fighting
seemed to concentrate itself around Quinn’s
Post. Three enemy galleries had been detected<span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</span>
there, and work on them stopped by
counter-mines, which killed twenty Turks and
injured thirty. One gallery
had however, been overlooked,
and at 3.30 <span class="allsmcap">A.M.</span> on
May 29 a mine was sprung in or near the centre
of Quinn’s Post. The explosion was followed by
a very heavy bomb attack, before which our
left centre subsection fell back, letting in a
storming party of Turks. This isolated one
subsection on the left from the two other subsections
on the right.</p>

<p>At 5.30 <span class="allsmcap">A.M.</span> our counter-attack was launched,
and by 6 <span class="allsmcap">A.M.</span> the position had been retaken
with the bayonet by the 15th Australian
Infantry Battalion, led by Major Quinn, who
was unfortunately killed. All the enemy in
the trench were killed or captured.</p>

<p>On May 30 preparations were made in
Quinn’s Post to attack and destroy two enemy
saps, the heads of which had reached within
five yards of our fire trench. Two storming
parties of thirty-five men went forward at 1 <span class="allsmcap">P.M.</span>,
cleared the sap heads and penetrated into the
trenches beyond, but they were gradually driven
back by bombs, of which the enemy seemed
to have an unlimited supply.</p>

<p>During May 31 close fighting continued in
front of Quinn’s Post.</p>

<p>On June 1, an hour after dark, two sappers
of the New Zealand Engineers courageously
crept out and laid a charge of gun-cotton against
a timber and sandbag bomb-proof. The structure
was completely demolished.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<div class="sidenotel">The Demonstrations</div>

<p>On June 4 three separate enterprises were
carried out by the Australian and New Zealand
Army Corps. These were
undertaken in compliance
with an order which I had
issued that the enemy’s attention should be
distracted during an attack I was about to
deliver in the southern zone.</p>

<p>First a demonstration in the direction of
Kaba Tepe, the Navy co-operating by bombarding
the Turkish trenches.</p>

<p>At Quinn’s Post an assault was delivered at
11 <span class="allsmcap">P.M.</span> A party of sixty men, accompanied
by a bomb-throwing party on either flank,
stormed the enemy’s trench. In the assault
many Turks were bayoneted and twenty-eight
captured. At 6.30 <span class="allsmcap">A.M.</span> the trench had to be
abandoned.</p>

<p>On June 5 a sortie was made by two officers
and 100 men of the 1st Australian Infantry,
the objective being the destruction of a machine-gun
in a trench (known as German Officer’s
Trench). The darkness of the trench and its
overhead cover prevented the use of the
bayonet, but some damage was done by shooting
down over the parapet. The aim of this
gallant assault being attained, the party withdrew
in good order with their wounded. Casualties
in all were thirty-six.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<div class="sidenote">“Enver’s
Attack”</div>

<p>On the night of June 29-30 the Turks,
acting, as we afterwards ascertained, under
the direct personal order of
Enver Pasha to drive us
all into the sea, made a big
attack on the Australian and New Zealand Army
Corps, principally on that portion of the line
which was under the command of Major-General
Sir A. J. Godley. From midnight
till 1.30 <span class="allsmcap">A.M.</span> a fire of musketry and guns of
greatest intensity was poured upon our trenches.
A heavy column then advanced to the assault,
and was completely crumpled up by the
musketry and machine-guns of the 7th and
8th Light Horse. An hour later another grand
attack took place against our left and left
centre, and was equally cut to pieces by our
artillery and rifle fire. The enemy’s casualties
may be judged by the fact that in areas directly
exposed to view between 400 and 500 were
actually seen to fall.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<div class="sidenote">Suvla and Sari
Bair—The
Great Battle
of August</div>

<p>From the very first I had hoped that by
landing a force under the heights of Sari Bair
we should be able to strangle
the Turkish communications
to the southwards, whether
by land or sea, and so clear
the Narrows for the Fleet.
Owing to the enemy’s superiority,
both in numbers and in position;
owing to under-estimates of the strength of the
original entrenchments prepared and sited under
German direction; owing to the constant
dwindling of the units of my force through
wastage; owing also to the intricacy and
difficulty of the terrain, these hopes had not<span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</span>
hitherto borne fruit. But they were well
founded. So much at least had clearly enough
been demonstrated by the desperate and costly
nature of the Turkish attacks. The Australians
and New Zealanders had rooted themselves
in very near to the vitals of the enemy. By
their tenacity and courage they still held open
the doorway from which one strong thrust forward
might give us command of the Narrows.</p>

<p>Before a man of the reinforcements had
arrived my mind was made up as to their
employment, and by means of a vigorous
offensive from Anzac, combined with a surprise
landing to the north of it, I meant to try and
win through to Maidos, leaving behind me a
well-protected line of communications starting
from the bay of Suvla.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<div class="sidenotel">Reinforcements</div>

<p>On the nights of August 4, 5, and 6, the
reinforcing troops were shipped into Anzac
very silently at the darkest
hours. Then, still silently,
they were tucked away from
enemy aeroplanes or observatories in their
prepared hiding-places. The whole sea route
lay open to the view of the Turks upon Achi
Baba’s summit and Battleship Hill. Aeroplanes
could count every tent and every ship at
Mudros or at Imbros. Within rifle fire of
Anzac’s open beach hostile riflemen were
looking out across the Ægean no more than
twenty feet from our opposing lines. Every
modern appliance of telescope, telegraph, wireless
was at the disposal of the enemy. Yet
the instructions worked out at General Headquarters
in the minutest detail (the result of
conferences with the Royal Navy, which were
attended by Brigadier-General Skeen, of General
Birdwood’s staff) were such that the scheme
was carried through without a hitch.</p>

<p>The troops now at the disposal of General
Birdwood amounted in round numbers to
37,000 rifles and seventy-two guns, with naval
support from two cruisers, four monitors, and
two destroyers. Under the scheme these
troops were to be divided into two main portions.
The task of holding the existing Anzac position,
and of making frontal assaults therefrom, was
assigned to the Australian Division (plus the
1st and 3rd Light Horse Brigades and two
battalions of the 40th Brigade); that of
assaulting the Chunuk Bair ridge was entrusted
to the New Zealand and Australian Division
(less the 1st and 3rd Light Horse Brigades), to
the 13th Division (less five battalions), and to
the 29th Indian Infantry Brigade and to the
Indian Mountain Artillery Brigade. The 29th
Brigade of the 10th Division (less one battalion)
and the 38th Brigade were held in reserve.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<div class="sidenote">The Assault
on Lone Pine</div>

<p>During August 4, 5, and 6, the works on
the enemy’s left and centre were subjected
to a slow bombardment, and
on the afternoon of August
6 an assault was made
upon the formidable Lone Pine entrenchment.
The work consisted of a strong <em>point d’appui</em>
on the south-western end of a plateau, where
it confronted, at distances varying from 60
to 120 yards, the salient in the line of our
trenches named by us the Pimple. The entrenchment
was evidently very strong; it
was entangled with wire, and provided with
overhead cover.</p>

<p>The detailed scheme of attack was worked
out with care and forethought by Major-General
H. B. Walker, commanding 1st Australian
Division, and his thoroughness contributed, I
consider, largely to the success of the enterprise.</p>

<p>The action commenced at 4.30 <span class="allsmcap">P.M.</span> with a
continuous and heavy bombardment of the
Lone Pine and adjacent trenches, H.M.S.
<em>Bacchante</em> assisting by searching the valleys
to the north-east and east, and the monitors
by shelling the enemy’s batteries south of
Gaba Tepe. The assault had been entrusted
to the 1st Australian Brigade (Brigadier-General
N. M. Smyth), and punctually at
5.30 <span class="allsmcap">P.M.</span> it was carried out by the 2nd, 3rd,
and 4th Australian Battalions, the 1st Battalion
forming the brigade reserve.</p>

<p>Two lines left their trenches simultaneously,
and were closely followed up by a third. The
rush across the open was a regular race against
death, which came in the shape of a hail of shell
and rifle bullets from front and from either
flank. But the Australians had firmly resolved
to reach the enemy’s trenches, and in this
determination they became for the moment
invincible. The barbed wire entanglement was
reached and was surmounted. Then came a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</span>
terrible moment, when it seemed as though it
would be physically impossible to penetrate
into the trenches. The overhead cover of stout
pine beams resisted all individual efforts to
move it, and the loopholes continued to spit
fire. Groups of our men then bodily lifted
up the beams and individual soldiers leaped
down into the semi-darkened galleries amongst
the Turks. By 5.47 <span class="allsmcap">P.M.</span> the 3rd and 4th
Battalions were well into the enemy’s vitals,
and a few minutes later the reserves of the
2nd Battalion advanced over their <em>parados</em>,
and driving out, killing, or capturing the
occupants, made good the whole of the trenches.
The reserve companies of the 3rd and 4th
Battalions followed, and at 6.20 <span class="allsmcap">P.M.</span> the 1st
Battalion (in reserve) was launched to consolidate
the position.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<div class="sidenotel">Counter-attack
at
Lone Pine</div>

<p>At once the Turks made it plain, as they
have never ceased to do since, that they had
no intention of acquiescing
in the capture of this capital
work. At 7.0 <span class="allsmcap">P.M.</span> a determined
and violent counter-attack
began.</p>

<p>For seven hours these counter-attacks continued.
All this time consolidation was being
attempted, although the presence of so many
Turkish prisoners hampered movement and
constituted an actual danger. In beating off
these desperate counter-attacks very heavy
casualties were suffered by the Australians.
Part of the 12th Battalion, the reserve of the
3rd Brigade, had therefore to be thrown into
the mêlée.</p>

<p>Twelve hours later, on the 7th, another
effort was made by the enemy, being resumed
at midnight and proceeding intermittently till
dawn. At an early period of this last counter-attack
the 4th Battalion were forced by bombs
to relinquish a portion of a trench, but later on,
led by their commanding officer, Lieutenant-Colonel
McNaghten, they killed every Turk
who had got in.</p>

<p>At 5 <span class="allsmcap">A.M.</span> on August 9, the enemy made
a sudden attempt to storm from the east and
south-east after a feint of fire attack from the
north. The 7th Battalion bore the brunt of
the shock, and handled the attack so vigorously
that by 7.45 <span class="allsmcap">A.M.</span> there were clear signs of
demoralisation in the enemy’s ranks. But
although this marked the end of counter-attacks
on the large scale, the bombing and
sniping continued, though in less volume,
throughout this day and night, and lasted till
August 12, when it at last became manifest
that we had gained complete ascendancy.</p>

<p>Thus was Lone Pine taken and held. The
Turks were in great force and very full of
fight, yet one weak Australian brigade, numbering
at the outset but 2,000 rifles, and supported
only by two weak battalions, carried
the work under the eyes of a whole enemy
division. The irresistible dash and daring of
officers and men in the initial charge were a
glory to Australia. In one corner eight Turks
and six Australians were found lying as they
had bayoneted one another. To make room
for the fighting men, the dead were ranged
in rows on either side of the gangway. After
the first violence of the counter-attacks had
abated, 1,000 corpses—our own and Turkish—were
dragged out from the trenches.</p>

<p>The Lone Pine attack drew all the local
enemy reserves towards it, and may be held,
more than any other cause, to have been the
reason that the Suvla Bay landing was so
lightly opposed. Our captures in this feat
of arms amounted to 134 prisoners, seven
machine-guns, and a large quantity of ammunition
and equipment.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<div class="sidenote">The Nek,
Baby 700
and German
Officer’s
Trench
Attacked</div>

<p>Other frontal attacks from the existing
Anzac positions were not so fortunate. They
included an attack upon the
work known as German
Officer’s Trench, on the extreme
right of our line, at
midnight on August 6-7,
also assaults on the Nek and
Baby 700 trenches opposite
the centre of our line, delivered
at 4.30 <span class="allsmcap">A.M.</span> on the 7th. The 2nd
Australian Brigade did all that men could do;
the Light Horse only accepted their repulse
after losing three-fourths of that devoted
band who so bravely sallied forth. All that
day, as the result of these most gallant attacks,
Turkish reserves on Battleship Hill were being
held back to meet any dangerous development
along the front of the old Anzac line,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</span>
and so were not available to meet our main
enterprise, which I will now endeavour to
describe.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<div class="sidenotel">The Main
Push</div>

<p>The first step in the real push—the step
which above all others was to count—was the
night attack on the summits
of the Sari Bair ridge.</p>

<p>It was our object to effect
a lodgment along the crest of the high main
ridge with two columns of troops, but, seeing
the nature of the ground and the dispositions
of the enemy, the effort had to be made by
stages. We were bound, in fact, to undertake
a double subsidiary operation before we could
hope to launch these attacks with any real
prospect of success. The two assaulting
columns, which were to work up three ravines
to the storm of the high ridge, were to be
preceded by two covering columns. One of
these was to capture the enemy’s positions commanding
the foothills, first to open the mouths
of the ravines, secondly to cover the right
flank of another covering force whilst it marched
along the beach. The other covering column
was to strike far out to the north until, from
a hill called Damakjelik Bair, it could at the
same time facilitate the landing of the 9th
Corps at Nibrunesi Point, and guard the left
flank of the column assaulting Sari Bair from
any forces of the enemy which might be
assembled in the Anafarta valley.</p>

<p>The whole of this big attack was placed
under the command of Major-General Sir
A. J. Godley, General Officer Commanding New
Zealand and Australian Division. The two
covering and the two assaulting columns were
organised as follows:</p>

<p>Right Covering Column, under Brigadier-General
A. H. Russell.—New Zealand Mounted
Rifles Brigade, the Otago Mounted Rifles
Regiment, the Maori Contingent and New
Zealand Field Troop.</p>

<p>Right Assaulting Column, under Brigadier-General
F. E. Johnston.—New Zealand Infantry
Brigade, Indian Mountain Battery (less
one section), one Company New Zealand
Engineers.</p>

<p>Left Covering Column, under Brigadier-General
J. H. Travers.—Headquarters 40th
Brigade, half the 72nd Field Company, 4th
Battalion South Wales Borderers, and 5th
Battalion Wiltshire Regiment.</p>

<p>Left Assaulting Column, under Brigadier-General
(now Major-General) H. V. Cox.—29th
Indian Infantry Brigade, 4th Australian
Infantry Brigade, Indian Mountain Battery
(less one section), one Company New Zealand
Engineers.</p>

<p>Divisional Reserve.—6th Battalion South
Lancashire Regiment and 8th Battalion
Welsh Regiment (Pioneers) at Chailak Dere,
and the 39th Infantry Brigade and half 72nd
Field Company at Aghyl Dere.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<div class="sidenote">In the
Foothills</div>

<p>The right covering column had to clear
the Turks off from their right flank positions
upon Old No. 3 Post and
Table Top.</p>

<p>Old No. 3 Post connected
with Table Top by a razor back. Working
parties had done their best with unstinted
material to convert this commanding point
into an impregnable redoubt. Two lines of
fire trench, very heavily entangled, protected
its southern face.</p>

<p>Table Top is a steep-sided, flat-topped hill,
close on 400 feet above sea level. The sides
of the hill are mostly sheer and quite impracticable.</p>

<p>Amongst other stratagems the Anzac troops,
assisted by H.M.S. <em>Colne</em>, had long and carefully
been educating the Turks how they
should lose Old No. 3 Post, which could hardly
have been rushed by simple force of arms.
Every night, exactly at 9 <span class="allsmcap">P.M.</span>, H.M.S. <em>Colne</em>
threw the beams of her searchlight on to the
redoubt, and opened fire upon it for exactly
ten minutes. Then, after a ten minutes’
interval, came a second illumination and bombardment,
commencing always at 9.20 and
ending precisely at 9.30 <span class="allsmcap">P.M.</span></p>

<p>The idea was that, after successive nights of
such practice, the enemy would get into the
habit of taking the searchlight as a hint to
clear out until the shelling was at an end. But
on the eventful night of the 6th, the sound of
their footsteps drowned by the loud cannonade,
unseen as they crept along in that darkest
shadow which fringes a searchlight’s beam—came
the right covering column. At 9.30 the
light switched off, and instantly our men poured<span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</span>
out of the scrub jungle and into the redoubt.
By 11 <span class="allsmcap">P.M.</span> the whole series of surrounding
entrenchments were ours!</p>

<p>The remainder of the right covering column
carried on with their attack upon Bauchop’s
Hill and the Chailak Dere. By 10 <span class="allsmcap">P.M.</span> the
northernmost point, with its machine-gun, was
captured, and by 1 o’clock in the morning the
whole of Bauchop’s Hill, a maze of ridge and
ravine, everywhere entrenched, was fairly in
our hands.</p>

<p>The attack along the Chailak Dere was not
so cleanly carried out—made, indeed, just
about as ugly a start as any enemy could wish.
Pressing eagerly forward through the night, the
little column of stormers found themselves
held up by a barbed-wire erection of unexampled
height, depth, and solidity, which completely
closed the only practicable entrance to the
ravine. Here that splendid body of men, the
Otago Mounted Rifles, lost some of their bravest
and their best, but in the end, when things were
beginning to seem desperate, a passage was
forced through the stubborn obstacle with most
conspicuous and cool courage by Captain Shera
and a party of New Zealand Engineers, supported
by the Maoris, who showed themselves
worthy descendants of the warriors of the Gate
Pah. Thus was the mouth of the Chailak
Dere opened in time to admit of the unopposed
entry of the right assaulting column.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<div class="sidenotel">Table Top</div>

<p>Simultaneously the attack on Table Top
had been launched under cover of a heavy
bombardment from H.M.S.
<em>Colne</em>. No general on peace
manœuvres would ask troops
to attempt so breakneck an enterprise. The
angle of Table Top’s ascent is recognised in our
regulations as “impracticable for infantry.”
But neither Turks nor angles of ascent were
destined to stop Russell or his New Zealanders
that night. The scarped heights were scaled,
the plateau was carried by midnight. With
this brilliant feat the task of the right covering
force was at an end. Its attacks had been
made with the bayonet and bomb only;
magazines were empty by order; hardly a
rifle shot had been fired. Some 150 prisoners
were captured as well as many rifles and much
equipment, ammunition and stores. No words
can do justice to the achievement of Brigadier-General
Russell and his men. There are exploits
which must be seen to be realised.</p>

<p>The right assaulting column had entered
the two southerly ravines—Sazli Beit Dere and
Chailak Dere—by midnight. At 1.30 <span class="allsmcap">A.M.</span>
began a hotly-contested fight for the trenches
on the lower part of Rhododendron Spur, whilst
the Chailak Dere column pressed steadily up
the valley against the enemy.</p>

<p>The left covering column, under Brigadier-General
Travers, after marching along the
beach to No. 3 Outpost, resumed its northerly
advance as soon as the attack on Bauchop’s
Hill had developed. Every trench encountered
was instantly rushed by the Borderers, until,
having reached the predetermined spot, the
whole column was unhesitatingly launched at
Damakjelik Bair. By 1.30 <span class="allsmcap">A.M.</span> the whole of
the hill was occupied, thus safeguarding the
left rear of the whole of the Anzac attack.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<div class="sidenote">On the Far
Left</div>

<p>The left assaulting column crossed the
Chailak Dere at 12.30 <span class="allsmcap">A.M.</span>, and entered the
Aghyl Dere at the heels of the
left covering column. The
surprise, on this side, was
complete. Two Turkish officers were caught
in their pyjamas; enemy arms and ammunition
were scattered in every direction.</p>

<p>The grand attack was now in full swing,
but the country gave new sensations in cliff
climbing even to officers and men who had
graduated over the goat tracks of Anzac. The
darkness of the night, the density of the scrub,
hands and knees progress up the spurs, sheer
physical fatigue, exhaustion of the spirit
caused by repeated hairbreadth escapes from
the hail of random bullets—all these combined
to take the edge off the energies of our troops.
At last, after advancing some distance up the
Aghyl Dere, the column split up into two
parts. The 4th Australian Brigade struggled,
fighting hard as they went, up to the north of
the northern fork of the Aghyl Dere, making
for Hill 305 (Koja Chemen Tepe). The 29th
Indian Infantry Brigade scrambled up the
southern fork of the Aghyl Dere and the spurs
north of it to the attack of a portion of the
Sari Bair ridge known as Hill Q.</p>

<p>Dawn broke and the crest line was not yet
in our hands, although, considering all things,
the left assaulting column had made a marvellous
advance. The 4th Australian Infantry
Brigade was on the line of the Asma Dere
(the next ravine north of the Aghyl Dere) and
the 29th Indian Infantry Brigade held the
ridge west of the Farm below Chunuk Bair and
along the spurs to the north-east. The enemy
had been flung back from ridge to ridge; an
excellent line for the renewal of the attack had
been secured, and (except for the exhaustion
of the troops) the auspices were propitious.</p>

<p>Turning to the right assaulting column, one
battalion, the Canterbury Infantry Battalion,
clambered slowly up the Sazli Beit Dere. The
remainder of the force, led by the Otago
Battalion, wound their way amongst the pitfalls
and forced their passage through the
scrub of the Chailak Dere, where fierce opposition
forced them ere long to deploy. Here,
too, the hopeless country was the main hindrance,
and it was not until 5.45 <span class="allsmcap">A.M.</span> that the
bulk of the column joined the Canterbury
Battalion on the lower slopes of Rhododendron
Spur. Eventually they entrenched on the top
of Rhododendron Spur, a quarter of a mile short
of Chunuk Bair—i.e. of victory.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<div class="sidenotel">End of
August 7th</div>

<p>At 9.30 <span class="allsmcap">A.M.</span> the two assaulting columns
pressed forward whilst our guns pounded the
enemy moving along the
Battleship Hill spurs. But
in spite of all their efforts
their increasing exhaustion as opposed to the
gathering strength of the enemy’s fresh troops
began to tell—they had shot their bolt. So
all day they clung to what they had captured
and strove to make ready for the night. All
had suffered heavily and all were very tired.</p>

<p>So ended the first phase of the fighting for
the Chunuk Bair ridge. Our aims had not
fully been attained, and the help we had hoped
for from Suvla had not been forthcoming.
Yet I fully endorse the words of General Birdwood
when he says: “The troops had performed
a feat which is without parallel.”</p>

<p>Great kudos is due to Major-Generals Godley
and Shaw for their arrangements; to Generals
Russell, Johnston, Cox, and Travers for their
leading; but most of all, as every one of these
officers will gladly admit, to the rank and file
for their fighting. Nor may I omit to add that
the true destroyer spirit with which H.M.S.
<em>Colne</em> (Commander Claude Seymour, R.N.)
and H.M.S. <em>Chelmer</em> (Commander Hugh T.
England, R.N.) backed us up will live in the
grateful memories of the Army.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<div class="sidenote">The Second
Attack</div>

<p>In the course of this afternoon (August 7th)
reconnaissances of Sari Bair were carried out
and the troops were got into
shape for a fresh advance
in three columns, to take
place in the early morning.</p>

<p>The columns were composed as follows:</p>

<p>Right Column, Brigadier-General F. E.
Johnston.—26th Indian Mountain Battery
(less one section), Auckland Mounted Rifles,
New Zealand Infantry Brigade, two battalions
13th Division, and the Maori Contingent.</p>

<p>Centre and Left Columns, Major-General
H. V. Cox.—21st Indian Mountain Battery
(less one section), 4th Australian Brigade,
39th Infantry Brigade (less one battalion),
with 6th Battalion South Lancashire Regiment
attached, and the 29th Indian Infantry
Brigade.</p>

<p>The right column was to climb up the Chunuk
Bair ridge; the left column was to make for
the prolongation of the ridge north-east to
Koja Chemen Tepe, the topmost peak of
the range.</p>

<p>The attack was timed for 4.15 <span class="allsmcap">A.M.</span> At
the first faint glimmer of dawn observers saw
figures moving against the sky-line of Chunuk
Bair. Were they our own men, or were they
the Turks? Telescopes were anxiously adjusted;
the light grew stronger; men were
seen climbing up from our side of the ridge;
they <em>were</em> our own fellows—the topmost summit
was ours!</p>

<hr class="tb">

<div class="sidenote">Chunuk Bair
Gained</div>

<p>On the right, General Johnston’s column,
headed by the Wellington Battalion and supported
by the 7th Battalion
Gloucestershire Regiment, the
Auckland Mounted Rifles
Regiment, the 8th Welsh Pioneers, and the
Maori Contingent, the whole most gallantly led
by Lieutenant-Colonel W. G. Malone, had raced
one another up the steep. Nothing could check
them. On they went, until, with a last determined<span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</span>
rush, they fixed themselves firmly on the
south-western slopes and crest of the main
knoll known as the height of Chunuk Bair. With
deep regret I have to add that the brave Lieutenant-Colonel
Malone fell mortally wounded
as he was marking out the line to be held.</p>

<p>In the centre the 39th Infantry Brigade and
the 29th Indian Brigade moved along the
gullies leading up to the Sari Bair ridge. So
murderous was the enemy’s fire that little
progress could be made, though some ground
was gained on the spurs to the north-east of
the Farm.</p>

<p>On the left the 4th Australian Brigade
advanced from the Asmak Dere against the
lower slopes of Abdul Rahman Bair (a spur
running due north from Koja Chemen Tepe)
with the intention of wheeling to its right and
advancing up the spur. Cunningly placed
Turkish machine-guns and a strong entrenched
body of infantry were ready for this move, and
the brigade were unable to get on. At last,
on the approach of heavy columns of the
enemy, the Australians, virtually surrounded,
and having already suffered losses of over
1,000, were withdrawn to their original position.</p>

<p>In the afternoon the battle slackened, excepting
always at Lone Pine, where the enemy
were still coming on in mass, and being mown
down by our fire. Elsewhere the troops were
busy digging and getting up water and food,
no child’s play, with their wretched lines of
communication running within musketry range
of the enemy.</p>

<p>At 4.30 <span class="allsmcap">A.M.</span> on August 9th, the Chunuk
Bair ridge and Hill Q were heavily shelled. At
5.16 <span class="allsmcap">A.M.</span> this tremendous bombardment was
to be switched off on to the flanks and reverse
slopes of the heights.</p>

<p>The columns for the renewed attack were
composed as follows:</p>

<p>No. 1 Column, Brigadier-General F. E.
Johnston.—26th Indian Mountain Battery
(less one section), the Auckland and Wellington
Mounted Rifles Regiments, the New Zealand
Infantry Brigade, and two battalions of the
13th Division.</p>

<p>No. 2 Column, Major-General H. V. Cox.—21st
Indian Mountain Battery (less one section),
4th Australian Brigade, 39th Brigade
(less the 7th Gloucesters, relieved), with the
6th Battalion South Lancashire Regiment
attached, and the Indian Infantry Brigade.</p>

<p>No. 3 Column, Brigadier-General A. H.
Baldwin, commanding 38th Infantry Brigade.—Two
battalions each from the 38th and 29th
Brigades and one from the 40th Brigade.</p>

<p>General Baldwin’s column had assembled in
the Chailak Dere, and was moving up towards
General Johnston’s headquarters. But in
spite of all precautions, the darkness, the rough
scrub-covered country, its sheer steepness, so
delayed the column that Baldwin, owing to the
darkness and the awful country, lost his way—through
no fault of his own.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<div class="sidenote">The Gurkhas
on Top</div>

<p>And now, under that fine leader, Major
C. G. L. Allanson, the 6th Gurkhas of the
29th Indian Infantry Brigade
pressed up the slopes of Sari
Bair, crowned the heights of
the col between Chunuk Bair and Hill Q, viewed
far beneath them the waters of the Hellespont,
viewed the Asiatic shores along which motor
transport was bringing supplies to the lighters.
But the fortune of war was against us. At
this supreme moment Baldwin’s column was
still a long way from our trenches on the
crest. And instead of Baldwin’s support came
suddenly a salvo of heavy shells.</p>

<p>The Turkish commander saw his chance;
and the South Lancashires and Gurkhas, who
had seen the promised land, were forced backwards
over the crest.</p>

<p>That evening from Chunuk Bair the line
ran down to the Farm and almost due north
to the Asma Dere southern watershed, whence
it continued westward to the sea near Asmak
Kuyu. On the right the Australian Division
was still holding its line and Lone Pine was
still being furiously attacked. The 1st Australian
Brigade was now reduced from 2,900 to
1,000, and the total casualties up to 8 <span class="allsmcap">P.M.</span> on
the 9th amounted to about 8,500. But the
troops were still in extraordinarily good heart.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<div class="sidenotel">A great
Turkish
Attack</div>

<p>During the night of the 9th-10th the New
Zealand and New Army troops on Chunuk Bair
were relieved. For three days and three
nights they had been ceaselessly fighting.
They were half dead with fatigue. Their lines<span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</span>
of communication, started from sea level, ran
across trackless ridges and ravines to an
altitude of 800 ft., and were
exposed all the way to snipers’
fire and artillery bombardment.
It had become
imperative, therefore, to get
them enough food, water, and rest; and for this
purpose it was imperative also to withdraw
them. Chunuk Bair, which they had so magnificently
held, was now handed over to two
battalions of the 13th Division.</p>

</figure>
<br>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</span></p>

<p>At daybreak on Tuesday, August 10, the
Turks delivered a grand attack from the line
Chunuk Bair—Hill Q against these two battalions,
already weakened in numbers, though
not in spirit, by previous fighting. First our
men were shelled by every enemy gun, and
then, at 5.30 <span class="allsmcap">A.M.</span>, were assaulted by a huge
column, consisting of no less than a full division
plus a regiment of three battalions. The North
Lancashire men were simply overwhelmed in
their shallow trenches by sheer weight of
numbers, whilst the Wilts, who were caught
out in the open, were literally almost annihilated.
The ponderous mass of the enemy
swept over the crest.</p>

<p>Now it was our turn. The warships and the
New Zealand and Australian Artillery, the
Indian Mounted Artillery Brigade, and the
69th Brigade Royal Field Artillery were getting
the chance of a lifetime. As the successive
solid lines of Turks topped the crest of the ridge
gaps were torn through their formation. They
became exposed not only to the full blast of the
guns, but also to a battery of ten machine-guns
belonging to the New Zealand Infantry Brigade,
which played upon their serried ranks at close
range until the barrels were red-hot. Enormous
losses were inflicted, especially by these
ten machine-guns; and of the swarms which
had once fairly crossed the crest line only the
merest handful ever straggled back to their
own side of Chunuk Bair.</p>

<p>At this same time strong forces of the enemy
were hurled against the Farm, where there
arose a conflict so deadly that it may be considered
as the climax of the four days’ fighting
for the ridge. Portions of our line were pierced
and the troops driven clean down the hill. At
the foot of the hill the men were rallied by
Staff Captain Street, who was there supervising
the transport of food and water. Without
a word, unhesitatingly, they followed him
back to the Farm, where they plunged again
into the midst of that series of struggles in
which generals fought in the ranks and men
dropped their scientific weapons and caught
one another by the throat.</p>

<p>By 10 <span class="allsmcap">A.M.</span> the effort of the enemy was spent.
Soon their shattered remnants began to trickle
back, and by night, except prisoners or wounded,
no live Turk was left upon our side of the
slope.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<div class="sidenote">End of the
Battle of
Sari Bair</div>

<p>By evening the total casualties of General
Birdwood’s force had reached 12,000, and
included a very large proportion
of officers. The 13th
Division of the New Army,
under Major-General Shaw,
had alone lost 6,000 out of
a grand total of 10,500. Baldwin was gone,
and all his staff. Ten commanding officers
out of thirteen had disappeared from the
fighting effectives. The Warwicks and the
Worcesters had lost literally every single
officer.</p>

<p>But physically, though Birdwood’s forces
were prepared to hold all they had got, they
were now too exhausted to attack—at least
until they had rested and reorganised.</p>

<p>The enemy’s positions were now being
rapidly entrenched, and, as I could not depend
on receiving reinforcing drafts, I was faced
with the danger that if I could not drive the
Turks back I might lose so many men that I
would find myself unable to hold the very extensive
new area of ground which had been
gained. I therefore decided to mass every
available man against Ismail Oglu Tepe, a <em>sine
qua non</em> to my plans whether as a first step
towards clearing the valley, or, if this proved
impossible, towards securing Suvla Bay and
Anzac Cove from shell fire.</p>

<p>The same day, a force consisting of two
battalions of New Zealand Mounted Rifles, two
battalions of the 29th Irish Brigade, the 4th
South Wales Borderers, and 29th Indian
Infantry Brigade, the whole under the command
of Major-General H. V. Cox, was working
independently to support the main attack.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</span></p>

<div class="sidenotel">Hill 60:
First Assault</div>

<p>General Cox divided his force into three
sections; the left section to press forward and
establish a permanent hold on
the existing lightly-held outpost
line covering the junction
of the 11th Division with the Anzac front;
the centre section to seize the well at Kabak
Kuyu, an asset of utmost value, whether to
ourselves or the enemy; the right section to
attack and capture the Turkish trenches on the
north-east side of the Kaiajik Aghala.</p>

<p>The advance of the left section was a success;
after a brisk engagement the well at Kabak
Kuyu was seized by the Indian Brigade, and,
by 4.30, the right column, under Brigadier-General
Russell, under heavy fire, effected a
lodgment on the Kaiajik Aghala, where our
men entrenched and began to dig communications
across the Kaiajik Dere towards the lines
of the 4th Australian Brigade south of the Dere.
A pretty stiff bomb fight ensued, in which
General Russell’s troops held their own through
the night against superior force. At 6 <span class="allsmcap">A.M.</span>
on the morning of August 22, General Russell,
reinforced by the newly-arrived 18th Australian
Battalion, attacked the summit of the Kaiajik
Aghala. The Australians carried 150 yards
of the trenches, losing heavily in so doing, and
were then forced to fall back again owing to
enfilade fire, though in the meantime the New
Zealand Mounted Rifles managed, in spite of
constant counter-attacks, to make good another
80 yards.</p>

<p>A counter-attack in strength launched by the
Turks at 10 <span class="allsmcap">A.M.</span> was repulsed; the new line
from the Kaiajik Aghala to Susuk Kuyu was
gradually strengthened, and eventually joined
on to the right of the 9th Army Corps, thereby
materially improving the whole situation.
During this action the 4th Australian Brigade,
which remained facing the Turks on the upper
part of the Kaiajik Aghala, was able to inflict
several hundred casualties on the enemy as
they retreated or endeavoured to reinforce.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>The last days of the month were illumined by
a brilliant affair carried through by the troops
under General Birdwood’s command. Our
object was to complete the capture of Hill
60 north of the Kaiajik Aghala, commenced
by Major-General Cox on August 21. Hill 60<span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</span>
overlooked the Biyuk Anafarta valley, and was
therefore tactically a very important feature.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<div class="sidenote">Second
Assault</div>

<p>The conduct of the attack
was again entrusted to Major-General
Cox, at whose disposal
were placed detachments from the 4th and
5th Australian Brigades, the New Zealand
Mounted Rifles Brigade, and the 5th Connaught
Rangers. The advance was timed to take place at
5 <span class="allsmcap">P.M.</span> on August 27, after the heaviest artillery
bombardment we could afford. This bombardment
seemed effective; but the moment the
assailants broke cover they were greeted by
an exceedingly hot fire from the enemy field
guns, rifles and machine-guns, followed after
a brief interval by a shower of heavy shell,
some of which, most happily, pitched into the
trenches of the Turks. On the right the detachment
from the 4th and 5th Australian Brigades
could make no headway against a battery of
machine-guns which confronted them. In the
centre the New Zealanders made a most determined
onslaught, and carried one side of the
topmost knoll. Hand-to-hand fighting continued
here till 9.30 <span class="allsmcap">P.M.</span>, when it was reported
that nine-tenths of the summit had been gained.</p>

<p>On the left the 250 men of the 5th Connaught
Rangers excited the admiration of all beholders
by the swiftness and cohesion of their charge.
In five minutes they had carried their objective,
the northern Turkish communications, when
they at once set to and began a lively bomb
fight along the trenches against strong parties
which came hurrying up from the enemy
supports and afterwards from their reserves.
At midnight fresh troops were to have strengthened
our grip upon the hill, but before that
hour the Irishmen had been out-bombed, and
the 9th Australian Light Horse, who had made
a most plucky attempt to recapture the lost
communication trench, had been repulsed.
Luckily, the New Zealand Mounted Rifles
refused to recognise that they were worsted.
Nothing would shift them. All that night
and all next day, through bombing, bayonet
charges, musketry, shrapnel, and heavy shell,
they hung on to their 150 yards of trench.
At 1 <span class="allsmcap">A.M.</span> on August 29, the 10th Light Horse
made another attack on the lost communication
trenches to the left, carried them, and finally<span class="pagenum" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</span>
held them. This gave us complete command of
the underfeature, an outlook over the Anafarta
Sagir valley, and safer lateral communications
between Anzac and Suvla Bay.</p>

<p>Three Turkish machine-guns and forty-six
prisoners were taken, as well as three trench
mortars, 300 Turkish rifles, 60,000 rounds of
ammunition, and 500 bombs. Four hundred
acres were added to the territories of Anzac.</p>

<p>And now, before affixing to this dispatch my
final signature as Commander-in-Chief of the
Mediterranean Expeditionary Force, let me
first pay tribute to the everlasting memory of
my dear comrades who will return no more.
Next, let me thank each and all, Generals,
Staff, Regimental Leaders, and rank and file,
for their wonderful loyalty, patience, and self-sacrifice.</p>

<p>So I bid them all farewell with a special
God-speed to the campaigners who have served
with me right through from the terrible yet
most glorious earlier days—the incomparable
29th Division; the young veterans of the Naval
Division; the ever-victorious Australians and
New Zealanders; the stout East Lancs, and
my own brave fellow-countrymen of the
Lowland Division of Scotland.</p>

<p class="drop-cap">Nobody seemed to know
much about him except that
he was generally considered
by all those who knew of him
in the squadron to be a “cold-foot,”
and his nickname was appropriately
“Icy.” Not that the others had any
particular cause to call him that,
but whenever “Beachy Bill” came
screeching overhead he would involuntarily
duck and then smile in that peculiar
manner of his as much as to say,
“I can’t help it!” Beachy wasn’t
his worst enemy, though, for if there
was anything that he dreaded it was
those Turkish “75’s.”<a id="FNanchor_17" href="#Footnote_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a> It used to
make us feel as if we could shake him
when we saw how he would double himself
up. And yet one never liked to
attempt anything of the kind whenever
he used that smile. Moreover, as he
was over six feet in height and correspondingly
strong, it would not have
been politic. His was a baffling smile,
recalling the peculiar smile of the
“Monna Lisa,” and, like it, unfathomable.
He was a very quiet kind of
chap, and when it was his turn to do
fatigues, he would go and perform
whatever was required of him without
ever grumbling. His mates used to
take a mean advantage of his good
nature, and would shunt all the work,
such as sweeping out the “possie,” or
trenches, on to him.</p>

<p>About the time of which I am writing
we had noticed that Abdul was
sapping somewhere down the gully.
Sometimes we could distinguish dark
shapes moving about, and no amount
of sniping on our part would stop them.
They worked only during the night,
and each morning we found that the
pile of new earth down the gully had
grown higher. At last we understood
his plan—and it came to our turn to
make a counter move.</p>

<p>One evening I was told off among
others to go out and dig a new trench in
front of Abdul’s new sap. We had to
block him from getting to a certain
place on the little ridge which hitherto
had been in “No-Man’s Land.” I
noticed that Icy had also been told off,
but he was to be one of the covering
party. All that night we worked hard,
digging ourselves in and filling sandbags
which we threw up in front of us.
At first we were undisturbed, but suddenly
the bullets began to ping-ping
over our heads, and we knew that Abdul
had tumbled. Still, as he was himself
intent on digging he did not come out
at us, but contented himself by sniping,
thinking to drive us off in that
way. However, it was a bit late in the
day for that; since by the time he
found us out we had already several
good sandbags filled, and these protected
us as long as we kept well
down.</p>

<p>Several of our chaps were winged,
but as none of the wounds was very
serious we didn’t mind that. When it
had struck five in the morning we<span class="pagenum" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</span>
knocked off and retired to sleep away
the day. Half a dozen bomb-throwers
who had volunteered for the job then
took our places, bringing with them a
few bombs, their rifles, ammunition,
water bottles, and a supply of bully
beef and biscuits. There they spent
the whole day, lying low under cover
of the sandbags. But Abdul troubled
them not! Next night we went out
again to resume work, and then it was
that certain things happened which
made us look upon Icy in a different
light.</p>

<p>We had no sooner started work
than <em>ra-ta-ta-ta-ta</em> went a machine-gun
somewhere out to the left, and the
bullets came pinging round hot and
close, winging three and killing two on
the first discharge.</p>

<p>John Turk had stolen a march on us
by placing a machine-gun away out on
his extreme flank where he could to a
certain extent enfilade us. That sort
of thing could not be allowed to last,
as we had to bury our noses in the
ground each time the confounded gun
opened up. Our covering party, being
out ahead of us, escaped the hail of
bullets better than we did. The place
was now becoming too hot to stay in,
so the order came along to retire independently
to our trenches, until something
could be done to stop the
machine-gun.</p>

<p>When we mustered again in the
trenches, we found that one man of the
covering party was missing. The man
was Icy. As we were talking about
him—wondering who should go back to
look for him—there came the noise of a
commotion from the direction of the
Turkish machine-gun. Bang! bang!
went a couple of bombs, followed by
cries and shouts from Abdul, and
above it all we were certain we heard
fragments of language, of the category
known in Australia as “bullocky.”<a id="FNanchor_18" href="#Footnote_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a>
What could it mean? By this time the
alarm had spread along the whole of
Abdul’s front trenches, which belched
forth liquid fire. In our own trenches
everyone had mechanically sprung to
arms; and we stood there wondering
while for fifteen minutes the Turks
fired without ceasing. Gradually the
noise subsided—and we noticed that for
some reason the machine-gun away on
the left was strangely quiet.</p>

<p>An hour later we were stealing out
again to have another attempt at completing
our new trenches when I
stumbled over the form of a man lying
prone. Bending over to see him, I
found it was Icy. His clothes were wet
and sticky with blood, and half underneath
his body there showed the muzzle
of a machine-gun. As we lifted him
up, we saw that the gun was there
complete, tripod and all.</p>

<p>We took him into the lines and
handed him over to the dressing-station;
and just before we came away
he opened his eyes and told enough for
us to realise that Icy had sneaked over
and stolen that Turkish gun. To this
day we don’t quite know how he did it,
as he never will talk about it; but before
they took him on to the hospital
ship next day—with his sixteen bullet
wounds and scratches all told—there
went down to see him a crowd in which
I was amongst the foremost, which
apologised to Icy very humbly.</p>

<p>And, do you know, he only smiled
back at us in that funny old way of his.</p>

</div>

<p class="drop-cap">As I look westward towards the
grey Ægean Sea, generally
peaceful, deep blue and ofttimes
appearing golden-hued
by the mystic hand of sunset, but
now flecked with ripples of white
like a distant hill-side strewn with
new-shorn lambs, and hurried on by
the murmurings of the grey sea’s
bride, the grey cloud-bearing Mother
Wind, as she splashes the foreshore
of this grey land with fleecy fringes
of her mate, and makes her way
over the grey hills, through rugged
landslip or tangled, stunted, unfriendly
evergreens, grey phantoms flit to and
fro, passing with a careless nod, as it
were, the little grey homes of those
whose thoughts so seldom had time to
feast on aught but the bright days
before the Peril came; but who now,
with a foretaste of hell in their souls,
need only such a day as this to
make them feel the presence of the
grey world’s messenger whose name is
Loneliness. Loneliness garbed in a
mantle of merging grey sea and grey
sky, trimmed with the spires and
turrets of grey and seemingly unsouled
ships, whose presence in the blue and
gold days was as that of old friends
well met, but which now seem to be
ragged rents in the solemn dress of
Loneliness, reminding one of a derelict’s
slovenly covering held together
over a hopeless breast by an old gold
brooch—perhaps the gift of a mother
or handed down from bygone ages.
Loneliness comes not to all of us
garbed in this fashion. To others, who
look eastward, she comes dressed in the
sombre clothes of the grey hill-side, and
with yearning eyes beckons them on to
the chances of the blue and gold life in
Constantinople; or, perchance, if their
luck is that of many another good
soldier, to that other grey life forever
with the grey seas, grey skies and grey
forgetfulness on these ghostly, forsaken
grey shores of Gallipoli.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="WHAT_FRANK_THOUGHT">WHAT FRANK THOUGHT</h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">A private sat under a tree.
It was not the Lone Pine, but
the other one. Winter had
stripped it of foliage, and all
around was bleak and uninviting.</p>

<p>In his bronzed fist, which had carried
buckets and biscuits since April 25th,
he held a letter, highly perfumed, from
his “young lady”—she whom he had
escorted on so many occasions to Sydney’s
social events in the piping days
of peace.</p>

<p>He had not heard from home since
embarkation, and had often wondered,
as he bathed in just enough water to
temper a whisky and shaved by means
of a lethal instrument better fitted for
cutting a hedge than a beard, whether
they really cared. A fit of hesitancy
now seized him, and he hardly liked to
read the letter. By means of the top
of a tin of sardines which he had bought
cheap—two bob he had paid for it on
the beach—he saw his unshaven face,
the neck of his soiled shirt, and his crop
of unkempt hair. He was interrupted
in this by the attentions a “little
friend” was paying him. This he
located. He then lighted the end of a
cigarette (which he had kept stowed
away in the top of his puttees) before
risking another glance at himself in the
top of the two-bob tin of sardines.</p>

<p>“What a guy,” he murmured. “If
Jessie could see me now, would she
turn me down for some cold-footed,
well-groomed fellow? I don’t think.
She’s all right, and would understand
it’s no gipsy tea we’re at.”</p>

<p>However, it was with some slight
nervousness that he opened the letter.
Following the customary greetings,
Jessie wrote:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Dearie, be sure to keep your hat on
at all times. Egypt, I hear, is awfully
hot about Christmas-time. The doctor
was telling me the other day that he
could hardly sit on the veranda of Shepheard’s
in the middle of the day. Keep
your hat on, even when at Shepheard’s.
The climate is so treacherous.
Doc. says he recommends this hotel.
Shall we send letters to you there?
Iced drinks and heavy meals are dangerous,
doc. says.”</p>
</div>

<p>This was more than flesh and blood
could stand. “Am I having my leg
pulled?” he asked. He looked at the
envelope, and found it had been posted
in Sydney thirteen months ago. He
swore roundly at the expense of the
postal people, and as all the rest of the
letter was hopelessly out of date, he
turned his attention to the next item
of his very belated mail. It was another
letter from Jessie. She again
rambled on about Egypt, its climatic
horrors and the dangers of Cairo’s
attractions.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</span></p>

<p>He bit his lip and smiled sourly
when he came across a passage which
related to the dancing deeds of a male
acquaintance of his.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Frank, as you know, has not enlisted
yet,” she wrote. “He is not
sure of a commission, because chaps are
called upon to pass a beastly exam.
He says it’s rot to ask him to sit for an
examination, and he would just hate to
serve in the ranks. In his case, ‘it
would be super-patriotic,’ he says, to
do so. I don’t understand what he
means by this, but no doubt you will.”</p>
</div>

<p>Hughie knew that the man referred
to was big enough to push all the Turks
off the Peninsula; and Jessie proved a
Job’s comforter when, later on, she
told him that Frank only attended
dances given for patriotic purposes.</p>

<p>The next item was a parcel containing
hair-oil, twenty-five costly cigars, a
cigar-holder, a suit of pyjamas, and a
booklet given away by a firm of tobacconists,
explaining to would-be-recruits
that “Henry Clays” would be forwarded
to any part of the Australasian
front free of carriage. The parcel was
addressed to Gallipoli.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Darling,” wrote Jessie, in the
letter that accompanied the parcel,
“keep these things in your tent.<a id="FNanchor_20" href="#Footnote_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a> It
must be a fag getting the oil you liked
so much. I suppose you have to walk
some distance from the firing-line to
the nearest shops. No doubt the cigars
will be acceptable after dinner, and,
later on, the pyjamas. Don’t think me
forward in sending the latter. But I
know fellows do wear them. I’ve seen
them advertised in the <cite>Herald</cite>. I am
sending these things for use in Turkey.</p>

<p>“I have read all about the charge
you chaps made on the 25th of April,
and hope you were allowed to get well
up in the front. It would just suit you.
I know it is dangerous, but Frank says
if it is dangerous for the men, how
much more dangerous must it be for
the officers. He says he will insist upon
leading his men in all charges. Between
you and me though, Hughie, I
don’t think he will enlist. He has
several pairs of lovely socks to hand by
to-day’s delivery from David Jones’s,
and if they are not for the yachting that
is to start next week, then I’m slow.
Frank and I are going to Randwick
Races on Saturday, and if we see anything
in your battalion colours we will
back it and buy something for you with
what we collect. Frank says he is sure
you would like us to do this.</p>

<p>“Please don’t get shot, dear. We
intend to send you lots of nice things
for Christmas.”</p>
</div>

<p>Hughie, a gay dog in the good old
ante-bellum days, who occupied a cosy
job and circulated his sovereigns,
tramped back to his dug-out through
the saps, revolving wicked thoughts
about Frank. Always a philosopher,
he cleaned his rifle with the hair-oil, cut
up the pyjamas to make pull-throughs,
and to newly arrived reinforcements
distributed the cigars. He and the old
hands had lost any appetite they ever
had for such comforts.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="THE_ANZAC_THUNDERSTORMFROM">THE ANZAC THUNDERSTORM—FROM
THE TRENCHES</h2>
</div>


<p class="drop-cap">Do not we know that fall of
night over Anzac!</p>

<p>Boom-boom! Boom-boom!
Boom-boom! All the afternoon
the warships on our right had
been engaged in the playful work of
tearing pieces from the hillsides of Achi
Baba, eight miles to the south of us,
ruining the trenches of our friend the
enemy, blowing up a supply base, a
mule train, dropping shells on the
forts, or indulging in some of the many
small acts of friendliness to which Jack
Tar is prone. As the evening wore on
we could see the flash from both shell
and gun.</p>

<p>About the time we finished our
frugal evening meal lightning began
to play in intermittent flashes, like a
heavenly searchlight, from far across
the hidden Narrows and Asia Minor,
and put to shame the puny bursts of
light from the handiwork of man. The
boats were still at it, but their dull
booming was now intermixed with the
rumble of distant thunder.</p>

<p>The lightning becomes more vivid.
There is a rattling, crashing roar from
the artillery of the skies that can never
be equalled by any earthly batteries.
Surely the Creator is in angry mood
to-night, as comes a deafening peal,
followed by vivid flashes of forked
lightning in fantastic shapes. One
seems a long arm with hooked fingers,
as though the Most High would grasp
one or both of the contending armies
and hurl them into the seas. The
lightning plays around the steel points
of the bayonets of the motionless
sentries, standing ever ready under the
parapets, and keeping a ceaseless watch
the night through on the enemy
trenches.</p>

<p>Trench and traverse, hill and valley,
are revealed by a brighter light than
that of day. The rude wooden crosses,
marking the places where, alas! too
many of Australasia’s best have fallen,
are brought out in bold relief against
the dark background of holly scrub,
and the narrow strips of winding roadway
on the long hillsides from the beach—the
work of months—up which perspiring
fatigue parties toil with rations,
water, ammunition and other necessary
stores the day long, are laid out as a
relief map by Heaven’s electricity.</p>

<p>A rattling, crashing roar, such as I
have never heard in any Australian
thunderstorm, is followed by a deafening
clap, and a huge ball of fire falls
earthward at terrific speed in the direction
of Constantinople, followed by a
sound as of a shattering explosion,
which causes the very hillsides to
quake, traverse and parapet to tremble,
and the roofs of dug-outs to send down
a shower of stones.</p>

<p>The ships have long given up the
unequal struggle to make their voices
heard against those of the elements,
and as the storm passes over, and the
rumblings of the thunder become more
and more distant and the lightning less
vivid, the veil is drawn from the face
of the moon, and the White Lady sails
out into her own once more.</p>

<p>The storm has had its effect on those
manning the trenches. The bubbling
rattle of the machine-gun, the sharp
crack of Turkish rifles, and the heavier
report of our own arms, which usually
punctuate the night, are noticeable by
their absence. The turmoil of an hour
ago has turned to unbelievable quiet.</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p class="no-indent"><em>Our special correspondent having been permitted the exceptional
privilege of obtaining some insight into the work of the Navy,
we are enabled to publish the following invaluable article</em>:</p>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">But was that really he? That
stylish pair of khaki-coloured
overall trousers surmounted by
a serviceable-looking British
warm patrol tunic of the same excellent
material? At first glance it was hard
to distinguish him from the dapper-looking
foot-gunner, with whom he was
engaged in lively conversation. Their
words were inaudible to us onlookers,
but from what one could gather the
foot-gunner was making some interesting
comments on the system of naval
pinnaces.</p>

<p>And was this all of the representative
of the greatest naval power that ever
placed foot upon the land? But as the
observer drew nearer, the flash of illumination
came. For there, poised elegantly
on the bows of the natty blue
trench sou’wester was the emblem of
Britain’s naval supremacy, the silver
anchor in a golden hoop.</p>

<p>“Shiver my corrugated iron!” he
was saying—using a phrase I remembered
having heard so often as a young
sub-midshipman (or “spotty,” as they
are affectionately known by their
seniors) on the old <em>Bellicasus</em>—when,
noting the presence of company, he
turned with a polite smile to the intruders
and waved his apologies. It
was then that one noted the true stamp
of the man. He was a sailor every inch
of him, from the drop of salt spray that
dangled lazily from the tip of his nose
to the purple-tinted seaweed that clung
affectionately to the soles of his boots;
and his speech was laden with that
peculiar crispness and alertness which
we associate with sailors; they imbibe
it from the salt atmosphere of the gun-room
and the ward-room. But what
struck one most about him was his
youthful appearance. “What’s What”
would probably give his age as 29<span class="pagenum" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</span>
(though he did not look a day more
than 28½), and yet from the three bands
on his cuff it was obvious to one of the
writer’s experience in naval matters
that he must be a subaltern-commander.</p>

<p>“Is it much like what you thought
it would be after all your training?” I
asked.</p>

<p>“Yes, pretty much,” was the reply,
with an oddly reminiscent smile.
“Iron is heavier than water, and a
pinnace afloat is worth six aground.”</p>

<p>Here, I realised, was a man of perception—one
who was fitted to guide
the destinies of a great nation.</p>

<p>“And the landing of all these vast
quantities of stores,” I urged; “is not
that a great task?”</p>

<p>“We do not land them,” he said impressively
and decisively, with the air
of one closing an argument. “We
unship them.”</p>

<p>I nodded understandingly. So that,
then, was the key to the great mystery.</p>

<h3>1. MAHOMED—AND AUSTRALIA</h3>

<p class="drop-cap">Mahomed was Mahomed.
He was also a guide. The
combination meant that he
knew everything, and what
he didn’t know he made up, and what
he made up he told so often that at
last he believed it.</p>

<p>We were on the usual Nile excursion—made
by nearly the whole Australasian
force at one time or another—to
Memphis and Sakkara.</p>

<p>A boat had been arranged, and
Mahomed tried to entertain us on the
boat. He did. Knowing our absence
from home and wives, he gave us a full
account of his three wives; also some
obscure, but not uninteresting, details
of their feelings towards each other.
Each was “a pearl,” and he didn’t
know which was the pearliest. The
idyllic peace of Mrs. Mahomed in triplicate
was enough to make one a
follower of the Prophet.</p>

<p>His next dissertation was on the
Koran. But theology doesn’t appeal
much to soldiers. Padres have reduced
their services to a maximum of twenty
minutes. Before long our astute guide
recognised a necessity of a change of
subject. He gave us riddles—<em>the</em>
riddle of the Sphinx: How one could
divide equally between two men a ten-gallon
flask of water with only three-
and seven-gallon flasks to do it with.
The best of us took nine moves to do
it in; Mahomed did it in five—and
looked humble. Then he gave us
another: Four men and their wives are
on one side of the Nile, and have to
pass over to the other; but their
jealousy will not allow any man to be
alone with a lady not his wife. Mahomed
threw this problem at us with an
air of triumph. There was the boat,
there were the four men, there were
the four wives, there was the Nile.</p>

<p>The Nile was certainly there, and our
puffing, stodgy steamer had gone two
or three miles before we gave it up.
We did give it up. Mahomed manipulated<span class="pagenum" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</span>
the ladies and their spouses with
ease, landed each on the other side, all
conventions being strictly observed.</p>

<p>Then the Pyramids came into view.
We were rather tired of the Pyramids.
But the guide wasn’t. What would a
guide be without Pyramids—or the
Pyramids without guides? So we
heard again all their history. Each
new Mahomed throws in a thousand
years or two more or less. But what is
a thousand years in Egypt?</p>

<p>We were tiring of the Pyramids.
Mahomed started on the other bank—Napoleon,
Napoleon’s towers, Napoleon’s
granaries, Napoleon’s fortifications.</p>

<p>Now there is a limit to all things.
We could stand Moses Island; we
could listen to the accounts of
Pharaohs, Pyramids, Sphinxes, and
Mrs. Sphinxes. But Napoleon!
Napoleon hadn’t even known Australia.</p>

<p>However, Mahomed was wound up.
He was inspired. He was even intrepid.
What if the infidel dogs did cut
down his baksheesh; they should have
the whole story. So the British (and
the Australasians) in Egypt went to
the wall. Napoleon reigned. He got
it all.</p>

<p>It was then that our youngest subaltern
put in an easy under-arm, and
Mahomed hit out!</p>

<p>“Yes, we know all that about
Napoleon,” said the sub., “but what
about Sir George Reid?”</p>

<p>We waited breathless. Was it a
boundary hit or a catch at point?</p>

<p>“Oh,” said Mahomed, “I know all
about Saint George Reid. He a great
man. There is his mound over there.”</p>

<p>“Ah!” we exclaimed. And then,
with happy inspiration, someone asked,
“Is he dead?”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes; dead a hundred years.
Saint George Reid, a very good and
great man. He has a fine tomb. If a
sick man goes there, he gets cured
quickly.”</p>

<p>We tipped Mahomed generously.</p>

<h3>2. ANZAC IN ALEX</h3>

<p class="drop-cap">I hardly think old Benci’s
little wineshop in Alexandria
will be known to many of the
A.N.Z.A.C., or to many Alexandrians
for that matter. But in
case any of you find yourselves ever in
Alexandria again, this is how you will
discover it:</p>

<p>Standing at the head of the Rue
Cherif Pacha—everyone in Alexandria
knows the Rue Cherif Pacha who
knows anything at all about the place—with
the Kodak Company’s fine shop
on your right hand and His Britannic
Majesty’s fine Caracol on your left, you
could reach it in three bomb-throws, if
the last of the three happened to be a
“googly” and swerved in from the off,
just round the corner into the Rue
Attarine. So, you see, it is right opposite
the Attarine Mosque; and as you
sit of an evening at Benci’s doorway,
smoking his cigarettes, with his wine
at your elbow, and watch the motley,
polyglot crowd ceaselessly passing, you
have your eyes always coming back to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</span>
the carved and inlaid door of the old
temple, and up the graceful minaret
into the great lift of a night sky
glorious with such liquid gold of stars
that memory of herself will take you
back to many a mellow night when
stars of even more melting loveliness
bent above you in your own homeland
down South.</p>

<p>But you never saw such a restless
crowd in an Australian or New Zealand
street as this double line of dapper
Europeans and of sallow Egyptians,
Syrians, Armenians and hungry-looking
Greeks, threading the low swirl of
khaki tunics and Arab rags. And ever
and anon the stream ebbs before your
“garry-driver’s” long-drawn “Haa-sib”
(mind out), to let pass some
official dignitary or some riotous party
of Kangaroos, or some handsome, red-tabbed
officer of the regular staff, or
maybe ’tis an even more handsome and
stalwart private of the ranks, beside
some dear, dainty, winsome thing
under one of those little fly-away hats,
with that dark kiss-curl clinging close
to her cheek—you know exactly the
kind of maid and the kind of curl I
mean.</p>

<p>And still the tall, quiet minaret
and the broad, quiet heaven seem to
lean together; and one grows pensive
sitting at Benci’s narrow door of a
summer evening.</p>

<p>Old Benci himself is a brisk little
Italian, doubtless of middle age. I
think it must have been as a mark of
affection that we called him “Old
Benci,” for his hair still keeps something
of its youthful brown. He has
not a word of English and about two
of French, but you know at once from
his open, sunny face that, like most of
his compatriots, he has a heart of gold;
and, at a price to fit a ranker’s pocket,
he keeps a Chianti that is first-rate.</p>

<p>It was Tillett who found him for us.
Tillett is a New Zealand Medical Corps
man, grey-headed, full of years and the
experience they have brought him;
equally at ease in French, Italian and
Spanish from his early life on the Continent,
and a dabbler in Greek and
German by way of diversion; but so
quiet and unassuming withal, and so
rarely confidential about himself and
his affairs, that we knew little of him
beyond that he was at that time doing
odd jobs of healing for the drivers of a
New Zealand battery withdrawn from
the Peninsula. For us he was a
most likeable chap, an excellent interpreter
when our mediocre French
failed, and—his chief merit—the discoverer
of Benci and his tavern. With
a palate tormented by stewed tea
and the heavy canteen beer beloved
of the yokels of Old England, he
had traversed wellnigh every quarter
of Alexandria in vain quest of the
cheap and honest draught wine that he
knew must be there somewhere, and
yet must be neither that so very
“ordinaire” red wine of France, nor
yet the wretched “health wines” of
Greece, that carry in their tang
memories of the physician and the sick-bed
of our pre-war days. And between
him and Old Benci there had grown up
quite a sincere affection, apart altogether
from Chianti at P.T. 1 per
glass.</p>

<p>It was delightful, the pantomime
that went on whenever any of us
arrived without Tillett. With a countenance
full of anxious solicitude,
Benci would point vaguely out into the
night, carry his forefinger to his own
grey head, and then up would go his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</span>
eyebrows in interrogation. This we
knew to mean, “Where is our friend
of the grey hair that you are here to-night
without him?” And one of us
would answer by laying his face to the
table and snoring heavily or in mimic
sentry-go along the passage. Oh, but
it was good to see the smile that broke
and beamed across his honest face, with
his pleasure at finding himself intelligible
to his country’s allies.</p>

<p>The rest of these allies, so far as our
coterie was concerned, were a sergeant
of the Ceylon Tea-planters, back from
Gallipoli in charge of his company’s
horses, and a Maori of that gallant,
reckless band whose “Komaté! Komaté!”
rang along those hills in
August—well-born and well-educated,
in physique strong and solid, but with
movements as quick and sure as a cat’s.
In this tanned army only the full lips
and the slightly flattened nose betrayed
his origin.</p>

<p>He and I had been friends at
the same New Zealand ’varsity, but,
like so many of the best of his race, he
was no “sticker,” and in the third year
of his medical course he had side-tracked
himself on troubled studies of
mind and consciousness and refused to
carry on with his dull public health and
medical jurisprudence. Since leaving
’varsity he had been living on his
means, he told me, spending most of
his time in wandering. Napier, the
tea-planter of Ceylon, was your well-bred,
clean-limbed, rather aggressively
healthy-minded young Englishman.</p>

<p>These three, at any rate, were the
centre of that bright little knot of
friends that, in a three months’ stay in
Alexandria, had drifted and stuck together
in a community of tastes and
ideas and downright liking for one
another. And though one or other
of us might be held by night pickets,
or C.B., or on visits to our hospitable
French and Italian friends, yet on
any night of the week, from seven till
midnight, you would find two or three
of us forgathered at the back of the
little shop in the shadow of the great
black casks and behind the wooden
grille that, while allowing us from the
dim interior a clear view of the street,
yet shut us off effectively from the eyes
of the night patrol. For it was before
Sir John Maxwell’s “Iron Law of
closing time” that we held our revelry
<em>chez</em> Benci, and it was safe to wager
that something was amiss if we went
home by any but the 1.10 <span class="allsmcap">A.M.</span> tram
for Ramleh, or by carriage even later.</p>

<p>But those were our palmy days in
Alexandria—the days before the swarm
of Tommies came, and our pockets
began to empty, and an officious picket
in the fullness of its own importance
went farther afield than Sisters Street
and patrolled the whole town in its
lumbering motor-wagons....</p>

<h3>1. THE FLOOD</h3>

<p class="drop-cap">And it came to pass that King
Hun called together his mighty
men and said unto them:</p>

<p>2. “Behold I have dreamed
a dream, and the Gott of Boasts hath
appeared unto me and said:</p>

<p>3. “‘Bring together all your ships
of the sea, your wealth of the land, and
your mighty men of valour, including
your first-born.</p>

<p>4. “‘For I say unto you, now is
The Day.</p>

<p>5. “‘Ye shall go forth to battle
against the kingdoms of the earth to
wage war against all who do not bow
down to thee and call thee “<em>The</em> One.”</p>

<p>6. “‘For I have decreed that thou
shalt rule the earth to the uttermost
corners of it.</p>

<p>7. “‘Let thou and thy son take but
six days’ rations in your haversacks, for
on the seventh day thou shalt dine at
the Palace of the Buckinghamites with
the King of the Allyites as thy mess
orderly.</p>

<p>8. “‘Forget not thy pomade nor
thy tooth-brush, neither shalt thou
leave behind thy gases nor thine iron
rations, for thou mayest have need of
them.</p>

<p>9. “‘And go ye forth to kill and
plunder; spare none, but put all to the
sword; and put your trust in yourself
alone—and—er, myself, if it so please
thee.</p>

<p>10. “‘For this is The Day.’”</p>

<p>11. And all his mighty men bowed
down to him and said: “O King, live
for ever; verily thou hast truly said, and
thy kingdom shall extend to the ends
of the earth and the heavens and to the
depths of the sea.”</p>

<p>12. So King Hun blew his bags out,
smote him on the chest, and called
aloud, saying, “I am IT.”</p>

<p>13. And the same day he brought
together all his legions of men and his
ships of the sea and all the wealth of
the land: for they were all ready.</p>

<p>14. And they counted and found
umpteen million men of valour, two
ships, seventeen anchors, fourteen shillings
and fivepence in gold, umpteen
billion rolls of paper money and ennygottsquantitee
gas.</p>

<p>15. But they left the two ships
at home, fastened to the seventeen
anchors.</p>

<p>16. And the King-of-all-the-Huns
said, “It is enough, IMSHEE!”<a id="FNanchor_22" href="#Footnote_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</span></p>

<p>17. So they imsheed.</p>

<p>18. Now, it came to pass that the
Huns ran amok both East and West,
North and South, and their cry was
“Strafe!” and “Ber-lud!” and they
got both in abundance.</p>

<p>19. For they threw themselves on
the neighbouring villages, breaking
through the back gate without warning,
and slaying the watchdog and the pig,
the husbandman and his wife, the baby
and the nurse, the cat and the canary.</p>

<p>20. Nor even did the Boy-about-the-place
have time to reach his air-gun
from off the shelf; for the Mad Mass
tarried not to wipe its sword, but only
to quench its blood-lust and its thirst.</p>

<p>21. And when they had laid waste
all that land, they boiled over into the
next.</p>

<p>22. But it came to pass that by this
time the cries of murder and children
in torment had reached far and wide,
and before another sun had set two
men met the horde of Huns.</p>

<p>23. And the Huns lifted up their
bleary eyes and asked, “Gott strafe,
but who vas dis dat do dry stob our
leedle game?”</p>

<p>24. And the Man-from-the-west
with the strong arm and the iron jaw
proclaimed to the multitude,</p>

<p>25. “I am K. of K., and THIS IS
THE END OF THE SECTION.”</p>

<p>26. And the Butchers all lifted up
their voices with one accord, saying,
“Gott sh-sh-traf,” and “Hic, Ber-lud.”</p>

<p>27. But the Huns stopped, yea,
verily.</p>

<p>28. And so it came to pass that the
King of the Huns dined not at the
Palace of the Buckinghamites with the
King of the Allyites as his mess orderly—neither
on the sixth day nor in the
sixth year.</p>

<p>29. But the King of the Huns and
Little Willie ate their iron rations
instead.</p>

<p>30. And the flood was over the face
of the earth for many days and many
nights till the Mighty Winds arose and
drove it back.</p>

<p>31. And behold, the King of the
Huns said unto himself, “Verily, it
was a dream, and instead of ‘The Day’
is now nothing but ‘The Night.’”</p>

<p>32. So he fell asleep.</p>

<p>33. And great was the fall thereof.</p>

<br>


<h3>2. THE BOOK OF JOBS</h3>

<p class="drop-cap">And it came to pass that on the
seventh day of the week of
the fourth month of the year,
being the twenty-fifth Sunday
after the Melbourne Cup, there journeyed
forth from the land of the
Greeks, yclept Lemnos, a mighty host.</p>

<p>2. And “Birdy” commanded them,
saying, “Take from the Turks the land
of Gallipoli, that we may occupy it.
Possess yourselves also of the command
of the Narrows, that all who are free
may enter.”</p>

<p>3. Therefore, the Colonels, Majors
and Captains took heed, and after much
lengthy pow-wowing issued to their
men this edict: “Hear ye, men of
Australia and New Zealand, what the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</span>
‘Boss’ hath commanded. Ye shall
girdle yourselves about with ammunition,
and, after landing as seems
meetest, make assault upon the hills
and valleys of Gallipoli, which the sons
of Abdul do hold to our detriment.”</p>

<p>4. To the Ninth, and the Tenth, and
the Eleventh, and the Twelfth Battalions
of foot soldiers this follower of
Medon addressed himself thus: “Prepare
ye the track that the First, Second
and other Brigades, even your comrades,
may make peaceful footing.
And each man take with him a first
field-dressing and two days’ rations, for
we know not what difficulties we might
encounter.”</p>

<p>5. And to the Army Medical Corps
likewise he addressed himself, commanding
them to attend to the weak,
the injured and the weary, and lo! his
words were not in vain, for the land
was treacherous and harboured many
pitfalls.</p>

<p>6. And it came further to pass that
the enemy proved themselves “hard-doers”;
yea, verily, they were a stubborn
folk, for they had builded unto
themselves dug-outs and trenches on
the land of their forefathers, and were
aware of the coming of the invader.</p>

<p>7. But “Birdie’s” host were of the
hills and dales; men of much cunning
and resourcefulness.</p>

<p>8. Therefore, without the flourish of
trumpets, they sallied forth to the
right, and to the left, and the centre.</p>

<p>9. And they did that which was right
in the sight of the “Boss,” for they
used their “Blocks” and held the
ground, which seemed impossible to
those not possessed of faith in his
judgment.</p>

<p>10. And on the day of the twenty-sixth,
and of the twenty-seventh, and
on succeeding days, they did also build
trenches, and burrow holes into the
earth like unto the rabbit, that they
might abide safely, for it was further
commanded that this should be
done.</p>

<p>11. Now it came to the ears of the
Chief, and it was a true saying, that
the Valley of Shrapnel was even as
Gehenna, fraught with many dangers
to the unwary. Therefore it was commanded
that the pioneers should prepare
a track crooked, making it thereby
difficult, yea, insurmountable.</p>

<p>12. And when this and sundry tasks
were completed, the First, the Second,
the Third and the other Brigades of
human pack-horses, so that the good
work might be continued, were reinforced
by a multitude of those who
are known as the Lost Horse Regiments.</p>

<p>13. And lo! the host of Birdwood
flourished amazingly, even to the extent
of rum and porridge.</p>

<p>14. By this time, being the twelfth
month of the same year, it waxed
“plurry” cold, even unto a fall of
snow, and the erstwhile Land of Jacko
did breed much “flue” and “pneu,”
and it did seem as though the plagues
of the ancient Gyppos had descended
upon them.</p>

<p>15. But the Iodine Infantry were
magnanimous with their potions; thus
in our generation the sick were cured
of their suffering, and the balm of
Gilead descended upon them.</p>

<p>16. At the time of the eleventh
month of the same year as this is
written a Chief of the Rulers journeyed
from afar to take counsel with his
chiefs, and, by his guiding, smooth out
and make plain the difficulties which
had beset their paths.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</span></p>

<p>17. This accomplished, it was given
unto “Birdie” that he should command
all, excepting only the good ship
<em>Argon</em>, which contains such a heterogeneous
mass as that good ship of
Noah’s did contain.</p>

<p>18. Now, the rest of the Acts of
Kitchener, and all that he did and said,
have they not been written in the
<cite>Peninsula Press</cite> and other vaporous
rags, erstwhile our “filthy contemporaries”?</p>

<p>19. Heed ye all of this, ye who dwell
in the Antipodes, for the time is nigh
when the clouds of war shall lift and
we may abide in halcyon peace; for
this is the Dinkum Book of Jobs, as
will be written in the Book of
Revelations.</p>

<h3>3. THE PERFECTLY TRUE PARABLE OF
THE SEVEN EGYPTIANS</h3>

<p class="drop-cap">Now a multitude of Egyptians
journeyed unto Anzac, even
nigh unto the seats of the
mighty. And when they had
come unto the place whereon it was
written they should rest, they took
counsel one with the other, saying,
“Lo, behold, we have no light.”</p>

<p>2. Then one, more bold than the
rest, journeyed forth to gather fuel that
peradventure had been washed to the
beach and had escaped the claws of
Apollyon, the Camp Commandant.
And after he had searched a while he
raised his eyes and praised Allah. For
near to the waters he found a tin can
having a wick, like unto the lamps of
his forefathers, even from the days of
the Prophet. And straightway he returneth
to his companions, saying:
“Rejoice with me, for Allah has been
bountiful and I have had good fortune.”
Thus saying, he kindled the
lamp, but it would not burn. And he
kindled it a second time, but still the
lamp refused to give her light. Then
they cast it into the fire, and they all
gathered round to enjoy the light and
warmth thereof.</p>

<p>3. And it came to pass that while
they yet warmed their hands there
was heard a mighty crash, and of the
“Gyppies” that remained were picked
up seven stretchers full.</p>

<p>4. Verily it is not meet at Anzac
to put to “base” uses such jam-tin
bombs and other trifles as Apollyon
abandoneth, even when you find them
kicking about on the seashore.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="THE_RAID_ON_LONDON">THE RAID ON LONDON</h2>
</div>

<p class="center no-indent"><em>A Modern Chronicle by Private PAT RIOT</em></p>

<p class="drop-cap">England has been conquered
by Julius Cæsar, William of
Normandy, nearly (but not
quite) by William of Germany,
and, lastly, by plain Bill of Australia.
And of the three it is clear that the
conquest of Australian Bill was the
most successful of all, when it is remembered
that at the time of his
triumphant entry into London he was
not the man he is; he was sick and
wounded. He did not invade the city
with his shield in front of him. He
was carried on it; he came a conqueror
on crutches.</p>

<p>Private Bill Kangaroo was a lanky,
sawny bushman who, when a certain
foreign militarism went mad and the
band began to play the concert of
Europe, read between the lines of his
newspaper, thought a bit, saddled his
brumby, and rode for the nearest town
that ran a railway, staying there just
long enough for a final shout. He
passed the doctor easily, took a quite
insanguinary oath (for once) to do his
job as a soldier, and went into camp.</p>

<p>How Private Bill made his kangaroo-like
leap up the ridges of Gallipoli has
been told by a war correspondent to a
public which had, up till then, been
vaguely aware of his existence as a poor
relation from a South Sea Island. It
is fairly certain that future historians
will teach that Australia was discovered
not by Captain Cook, explorer, but by
Mr. Ashmead Bartlett, war correspondent.
Anyhow, the finding and exploration
of the territory is not in the
same continent as the discovery and
exploration of its people, and Bill has
seen the correspondent in the trenches,
and regards him with much more
curiosity than ever he regarded the
quondam explorer. But he was unconcerned
with these things, and was
acting co-respondent in the case of
Crescent <em>v.</em> Southern Cross when a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</span>
sniper’s bullet hit him in the neck and
put him out of court. A hospital ship
brought him to the City of London.</p>

<p>London first came to know him
through the medium of its most useful
person, the policeman. Bill had no
love for a policeman as a reader of Riot
Acts, but he developed quite an affection
for him as a Pointer of the Way.
“I’m bushed” became a familiar
greeting between them, and the
Kangaroo was never disappointed when
he strolled across the street to ask
P.C. 49 the way he should go. A
London motor-bus might have done
what a Turkish bullet failed to do if
the man in blue had not stopped the
traffic and played the part of pilot to
him. The raised hand that held up the
stream only for royal persons was lifted
for the strolling soldier from the South,
and the busmen laughed at the bushman.
To be “bushed” in the heart
of London became a common experience
with him, and one had a suspicion
that nefarious taxicab drivers often
took advantage of his innocence of
locality to drive him in circles before
dropping him at his destination, perhaps
five minutes from the starting
place. It was the shortness of city
distances that puzzled him, and he was
amazed to find names that were historical
and household words 12,000
miles away borne by quite unpretentious
streets and lanes. When English
people learned that he had travelled
1,000 miles to pass a doctor and join
the Army, they gasped and said he
must be joking.</p>

<p>What a class war failed to do, a race
war has done. The poor and their
patrons, noblemen gentle and simple,
vied with each other in dealing hospitably
by the private soldier who had
climbed the heights that commanded a
view of the Past and the Future. In
the stately homes of England, Bill (in
the servant’s phrase) met the “big
guns” as “one of themselves,” and
was astonished at the surprise thus
caused. But he was amazed, in turn,
when the servants told him they had
been in the house ten years. With
many embellishments, he assured them
that a girl in service in Sydney would
think she owned the house if she
stopped so long in one place.</p>

<p>To Bill, going into the Carlton or
the Hotel Cecil wasn’t sitting in the
seats of the mighty, but just the same
as entering the pub at Yungaburrah,
and he wandered in these places without
any desire to “cut a dash.” He
approved of the costly surroundings,
but when he saw the smallness of the
glasses put before him, Bill sat in the
seats of the scornful. He really enjoyed
himself better in that inn where he
found a group of Cockney cronies.
The landlord had to respond repeatedly
to his “Fill ’em up again,” and Bill
afterwards declared it to be the cheapest
night’s fun in the town.</p>

<p>Parsimonious people would say that
Bill Kangaroo didn’t know the value of
money, for it took him some time to
appreciate the small coins of the realm
at their face value. He thought it
looked mean to keep on asking, “How
much?” and when seeing the sights of
the city he always pulled out silver
more than sufficient to cover expenses.
The pennies he received in change soon
filled his pocket, and at first he gave
them away; but as he saw that he
would soon be penniless, he would go
into one of those places described as
being “strictly within the meaning of
the Act,” and surreptitiously ask the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</span>
barman if he could do with change.
His dislike of the base metal and a
habit of tipping in silver bade fair to
earn for him the nickname of the
“Silver King.” Tipping he reckoned
a curse, but, knowing that many men
lived by tips alone, he passed the coin
quite as cordially as he disliked the
practice. Bill never bought in the
cheapest market to sell in the dearest;
he didn’t think it “on the square.”</p>

<p>His greatest adventure was the
Zeppelins. Seated in a theatre one
evening, he heard a woof! And just
after that a second one, closer a third,
a fourth, and then a fifth just outside.
Woof! Crash! Men and women
began to rush for the doors, until the
man who rose to the occasion on that
memorable 25th rose to this one, and
shouted above the tumult of falling
glass and tramping feet that it was safer
in than out, and that if they kept their
seats all would be well. The actresses
on the stage, though quaking with
fright, stuck pluckily to their parts
until the final act. Bill himself wanted
dearly to go out and see the infernal
machines and their effect, but, for
example’s sake, he stayed till order was
restored, when he slipped out of the
building.</p>

<p>What he saw outside filled him with
thankfulness that he was a soldier, helping
to smash the raiders and their kind.
Wandering down the street, past great
gaping holes in the roadway, an overturned
motor-bus and some wrecked
buildings, he found himself on the
Embankment, and then on the bridge,
where he saw a damaged arch of
masonry. He sat down to think,
little dreaming that he was fulfilling
Macaulay’s prophecy concerning the
man from “down under” sitting on
the ruins of London Bridge.</p>

<p>Bill’s furlough was finished shortly
after this; his raid terminated with
that of the Zeppelins. He was glad to
return to the front; and he knows now
that, in assisting in the pruning of
Prussia, he is fighting for more things
than ever he thought of when he took
the oath of allegiance.</p>

<p>But he swears that when the job is
done he will again visit the land of his
father’s fathers, and toast it in a big,
big toast.</p>

<p class="center no-indent">The following are some of the “special orders” issued on notable occasions to the
officers and men of the A. &amp; N. Z. Army Corps.</p>


<h3>I. THE LANDING</h3>

<p class="center no-indent">AUSTRALIAN AND NEW ZEALAND ARMY CORPS</p>

<p class="right">
<em>April, 1915.</em><br>
</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Officers and Men</span>,—In conjunction with
the Navy, we are about to undertake one of
the most difficult tasks any soldier can be
called on to perform, and a problem which
has puzzled many soldiers for years past.
That we will succeed I have no doubt, simply
because I know your full determination to
do so. Lord Kitchener has told us that he
lays special stress on the rôle the Army has
to play in this particular operation, the success
of which will be a very severe blow to the
enemy—indeed, as severe as any he could
receive in France. It will go down to history
to the glory of the soldiers of Australia and New
Zealand. Before we start, there are one or
two points which I must impress on all, and
I most earnestly beg every single man to
listen attentively and take these to heart.</p>

<p>We are going to have a real hard and rough
time of it until, at all events, we have turned
the enemy out of our first objective. Hard,
rough times none of us mind, but to get through
them successfully we must always keep before
us the following facts. Every possible endeavour
will be made to bring up transport
as often as possible; but the country whither
we are bound is very difficult, and we may
not be able to get our wagons anywhere near
us for days, so men must not think their wants
have been neglected if they do not get all
they want. On landing it will be necessary
for every individual to carry with him all his
requirements in food and clothing for three
days, as we may not see our transport till
then. Remember then that it is essential
for everyone to take the very greatest care
not only of his food, but of his ammunition,
the replenishment of which will be very difficult.
Men are liable to throw away their food the first
day out and to finish their water bottles as soon
as they start marching. If you do this now,
we can hardly hope for success, as unfed men
cannot fight, and you must make an effort to
try and refrain from starting on your water
bottles until quite late in the day. Once you
begin drinking you cannot stop, and a water
bottle is very soon emptied.</p>

<p>Also as regards ammunition—you must not
waste it by firing away indiscriminately at
no target. The time will come when we shall
find the enemy in well entrenched positions
from which we shall have to turn them out,
when all our ammunition will be required;
and remember,</p>

<div class="blockquot">

Concealment whenever possible,<br>
Covering fire always,<br>
Control of fire and control of your men,<br>
Communications never to be neglected.<br>

<h3>II. THE BATTLES OF AUGUST</h3>

<p class="center no-indent">SPECIAL ORDER</p>

<p class="center no-indent"><span class="smcap">By General Sir Ian Hamilton</span>, G.C.B., D.S.O., A.D.C.<br>
Commander-in-Chief, Mediterranean Expeditionary Force.</p>

<p class="right">
<span class="smcap" style="padding-right: 2em">General Headquarters,</span><br>
<span style="padding-right: 1em">Mediterranean Expeditionary Force.</span><br>
<em>September 7, 1915.</em><br>
</p>

<p>The Commander-in-Chief, Mediterranean Expeditionary
Force, desires formally to record
the fine feat of arms achieved by the troops
under the command of Lieutenant-General Sir
W. R. Birdwood during the battle of Sari Bair.</p>

<p>The fervent desire of all ranks to close with
the enemy, the impetuosity of their onset and
the steadfast valour with which they maintained
the long struggle, these will surely<span class="pagenum" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</span>
make appeal to their fellow-countrymen all
over the world.</p>

<p>The gallant capture of the almost impregnable
Lone Pine trenches by the Australian
Division, and the equally gallant defence of
the position against repeated counter-attacks
are exploits which will live in history. The
determined assaults carried out from other
parts of the Australian Division’s line were
also of inestimable service to the whole force,
preventing as they did the movement of large
bodies of reinforcements to the northern flank.</p>

<p>The troops under the command of Major-General
Sir A. J. Godley, and particularly the
New Zealand and Australian Division, were
called upon to carry out one of the most difficult
military operations that has ever been attempted—a
night march and assault by several columns
in intricate mountainous country, strongly
entrenched, and held by a numerous and determined
enemy. Their brilliant conduct during
this operation and the success they achieved
have won for them a reputation as soldiers of
whom any country must be proud.</p>

<p>To the Australian and New Zealand Army
Corps, therefore, and to those who were associated
with that famous Corps in the battle of
Sari Bair—the Maoris, Sikhs, Gurkhas, and
the new troops of the 10th and 13th Divisions
from the Old Country—Sir Ian Hamilton
tenders his appreciation of their efforts, his
admiration of their gallantry, and his thanks
for their achievements. It is an honour to
command a force which numbers such men
as these in its ranks, and it is the Commander-in-Chief’s
high privilege to acknowledge that
honour.</p>

<h3>III. ARRIVAL OF 2nd AUSTRALIAN DIVISION, AND
SINKING OF THE <em>SOUTHLAND</em></h3>

<p class="right">
<span class="smcap" style="padding-right: 1em">Army Corps Headquarters,</span><br>
<em>September 7, 1915</em>.<br>
</p>

<p>In welcoming the 2nd Australian Division
to join the Australian and New Zealand Army
Corps, the General Officer Commanding, on
behalf of all their comrades now serving on the
Peninsula, wishes to convey to them our general
feeling of admiration for the gallant behaviour
of all ranks on board the transport <em>Southland</em>,
when that vessel was torpedoed on the 2nd inst.</p>

<p>All the troops of the Empire now serving
with the Army Corps have heard with pride
of the courage and discipline shown at a moment
when the nerves of the bravest were liable
to be so highly tried. Not only was there
not the slightest confusion on the part of the
troops, who quietly fell in prepared to meet
whatever fate might be in store for them,
but later on when there was a prospect of the
<em>Southland</em> being able to make her way under
her own steam, and volunteer stokers were
called for, men at once came forward for this
duty and successfully helped in getting the
<em>Southland</em> into Mudros.</p>

<p>The 2nd Australian Division knows well the
high reputation it has to live up to, to carry
on the brave deeds done by those who have
been here earlier in the campaign, but with
men like those on the <em>Southland</em> we are fully
assured that our new comrades are going to
prove themselves equal in all ways to the old
hands who have fought so well.</p>

<h3>IV. LORD KITCHENER’S MESSAGE</h3>

<p class="center no-indent">AUSTRALIAN AND NEW ZEALAND ARMY CORPS</p>

<p class="right">
<span class="smcap" style="padding-right: 2em">Special Army Corps Order,</span><br>
<em>November 25, 1915</em>.<br>
</p>

<p>Lord Kitchener has desired me to convey
to the Australian and New Zealand Army
Corps, a message with which he was specially
entrusted by the King to bring to our Army
Corps.</p>

<p>His Majesty commanded Lord Kitchener
to express his high appreciation of the gallant
and unflinching conduct of our men through<span class="pagenum" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</span>
fighting which has been as hard as any yet seen
during the war, and His Majesty wishes to
express his complete confidence in the determination
and fighting qualities of our men
to assist in carrying this war to an entirely
successful termination.</p>

<p>Lord Kitchener has ordered me to express
to all the very great pleasure it gave him
to have the opportunity, which he considers
a privilege, of visiting “ANZAC” to see for
himself some of the wonderfully good work
which has been done by the officers and men
of our Army Corps, as it was not until he
had himself seen the positions we had captured
and held, that he was able fully to realise the
magnitude of the work which has been accomplished.
Lord Kitchener much regretted that
time did not permit of his seeing the whole
Corps, but he was very pleased to see a considerable
proportion of officers and men, and
to find all in such good heart, and so confidently
imbued with that grand spirit, which
has carried them through all their trials and
many dangerous feats of arms, a spirit which
he is quite confident they will maintain to the
end, until they have taken their full share in
completely overthrowing our enemies.</p>

<p>Boys! We may all well be proud to receive
such messages, and it is up to all of us to live
up to them and prove their truth.</p>

OF A. &amp; N. Z. ARMY CORPS</h3>

<p class="right">
<span class="smcap">Australian and New Zealand Army Corps</span>,<br>
<em>December 1, 1915</em>.<br>
</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Boys</span>,—I cannot tell you how really sorry I
am to be leaving “Anzac,” as I have to do
on shifting over to Army Headquarters.</p>

<p>I have not, however, any intention of saying
“Good-bye” to anyone, for I trust it is by no
means “Good-bye,” as I still hope and intend
to see as much of all my old friends in the Army
Corps as I possibly can do.</p>

<p>Nor am I going to express my thanks to
officers and men, even if I could find words
to do so. I feel it would only be presumption
on my part, for it is for the British Empire to
do that; and I well know it will do so.</p>

<p>My one wish is to be able to finish this war
alongside of all my old comrades of “Anzac”;
having begun it together close on a year ago
now in Egypt, I sincerely trust that many
of us may be spared to see it through together,
when the time comes to make an end of our
German enemies, though that day may be yet
far distant.</p>

<h3>VI. THE EVACUATION OF ANZAC</h3>

<p class="center no-indent">SPECIAL ORDER OF THE DAY</p>

<p class="right">
<span class="smcap" style="padding-right: 2em">General Headquarters,</span><br>
<em>December 21, 1915</em>.<br>
</p>

<p>The Commander-in-Chief desires to express
to all ranks in the Dardanelles Army his unreserved
appreciation of the way in which the
recent operations, ending in the evacuation
of the “Anzac” and “Suvla” positions, have
been carried to an issue successful beyond his
hopes. The arrangements made for withdrawal,
and for keeping the enemy in ignorance
of the operation which was taking place, could
not have been improved. The General Officer
Commanding Dardanelles Army, and the
General Officers Commanding the Australian
and New Zealand and 9th Army Corps, may
pride themselves on an achievement without
parallel in the annals of war. The Army and
Corps Staffs, Divisional and subordinate Commanders
and their Staffs, and the Naval and
Military Beach Staffs, proved themselves more
than equal to the most difficult task which
could have been thrown upon them. Regimental
officers, non-commissioned officers and
men carried out, without a hitch, the most
trying operation which soldiers can be called
upon to undertake—a withdrawal in the face<span class="pagenum" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</span>
of the enemy—in a manner reflecting the
highest credit on the discipline and soldierly
qualities of the troops.</p>

<p>It is no exaggeration to call this achievement
one without parallel. To disengage and
to withdraw from a bold and active enemy
is the most difficult of all military operations;
and in this case the withdrawal was effected
by surprise, with the opposing forces at close
grips—in many cases within a few yards of
each other. Such an operation, when succeeded
by a re-embarkation from an open
beach, is one for which military history contains
no precedent.</p>

<p>During the past months the troops of Great
Britain and Ireland, Australia and New Zealand,
Newfoundland and India fighting side by side,
have invariably proved their superiority over
the enemy, have contained the best fighting
troops in the Ottoman Army in their front,
and have prevented the Germans from employing
their Turkish allies against us elsewhere.</p>

<p>No soldier relishes undertaking a withdrawal
from before the enemy. It is hard to
leave behind the graves of good comrades,
and to relinquish positions so hardly won and
so gallantly maintained as those we have left.
But all ranks in the Dardanelles Army will
realise that in this matter they were but carrying
out the orders of His Majesty’s Government,
so that they might in due course be
more usefully employed in fighting elsewhere
for their King, their Country, and the
Empire.</p>

<p>There is only one consideration—what is
best for the furtherance of the common cause.
In that spirit the withdrawal was carried out,
and in that spirit the Australian and New
Zealand and the 9th Army Corps have proved,
and will continue to prove, themselves second
to none as soldiers of the Empire.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dear Mr. Editor</span>,—Thinking that perhaps
a little news about a hitherto unheard of department
of the army (i.e. a Field Ambulance)
might interest you, I have set down (having
previously obtained the kind permission of the
great-grandchildren of the justly celebrated
Mr. Euclid, late of these parts, deceased) such
axioms as will be of use and guidance to those
requiring to know the habits of a Field Ambulance.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p style="padding-left: 2em; text-indent: -1.5em;">Ax. 1.—A Field Ambulance shall be an
irregular conglomeration of humanity
and other animals, which shall never
under any circumstances conform to any
fixed order or condition.</p>

<p style="padding-left: 2em; text-indent: -1.5em;">Ax. 2.—Whenever possible, the number
of N.C.O.’s in a Field Ambulance shall
exceed the number of men by 50 per
cent., in order that the said N.C.O.’s
may have a twenty-four hours’ rest when
on duty, supervising fatigues, etc. (This
Axiom is taken from the detailed
account of Corps Orders made by
William the Conqueror in the year 1066.)</p>

<p style="padding-left: 2em; text-indent: -1.5em;">Ax. 3.—A Field Ambulance shall never
under any circumstances move off on
the first instance, but all necessary
fatigue for the moving shall be fully
indulged. Only under extreme circumstances
may it move on the second instance.
(Vide AAZQP, Para. 14490053.)</p>

<p style="padding-left: 2em; text-indent: -1.5em;">Ax. 4.—All batmen in a Field Ambulance
shall be equal to anything.</p>

<p style="padding-left: 2em; text-indent: -1.5em;">Ax. 5.—If at any time a Field Ambulance
should be lost, the finder will, provided
he doesn’t require it for a war curio,
immediately place it in the most isolated
place available, and forget it, because
several others are trying to do the same.</p>
</div>

<p>—Yours truly,</p>

Decem., 1915.</em><br>
</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dear Abdul</span>,—I’m scribbling this letter in
the trench with my back to the wall, and I’ve
heaps of good news that I’d better get down
while I think of it all. You’ve been so abnormally
quiet—say, Abdul, has something gone
wrong? Not a charge or a sign of a riot, not
for ever and ever so long. They tell me you’re
sick of campaigning, that you’d aim in your
kit if you could; that your courage and patience
are waning, and the prospects ain’t looking
too good. Are you counting your hopes of
returning to that little home there in the
wood, where there’s peace, and a good fire
burning, and the rations are plenty and good?</p>

<p>It’s near Christmas, you know—that’s the
reason we’ve buried our growls for a while;
for you couldn’t be sad in the season when
everyone’s wearing a smile. But, of course,
I forgot you’re not sharing the joy that we
Christians know, and I guess you’re not giving
or caring a damn for the whole bally show.</p>

<p>I’ll chance that it gives you the “willies”—if
you’ve heard, it won’t hurt to repeat—that
the cards and the boys’ Christmas billies<a id="FNanchor_26" href="#Footnote_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a> are
here, and no kid, they’re a treat. Plum duff
for the boys who’ve been fighting on the
biscuit and beef (army store); I tell you we
don’t need inviting to back in our carts for
some more. Gee, the chocolate and cake are
delicious, and there’s sweets and smokes in
my pail, and a card with the sender’s best
wishes—I’m sending my thanks per this mail.
Folks who reckon that loving is living, whose
hearts are as big as their land, whose happiness
centres in giving—that’s <em>our</em> folks and <em>their</em> old-fashioned
stand.</p>

<p>Well, Abdul, I’ll finish this trifle, for my
thoughts are beginning to drift, and the sergeant
has passed me my rifle, and it’s time I took over
my shift. I’m concluding this note with a
moral—take a tip from a bloke in the know—pick
your men when you’re picking a quarrel.<br>
—Yours truly,</p>

<p class="right">
<span class="smcap">Australia Joe</span>.<br>
</p>

<p>P.S.—By the way, they’ve been stating that
you’re scared to come out any more; don’t
forget there’s a welcome here waiting, a warm
one, you bet; au revoir.</p>

you submitted us. Our head printer is a
married man with a growing family, and sternly
refuses to handle your matter. So that settles
it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Anxious.</span>—Your cold feet complaint must
not necessarily be a chronic affliction. Many
chaps have been permanently cured by a little
vigorous pedestrian exercise: such as vaulting
the parapet and bogging into a dinkum bayonet
charge. So cheer up! It will go away of
its own accord once you get “warmed up
to it.”</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Comic-Cuts.</span>—Sorry all the generals you
have so far seen do not come up to your humorous
expectations. When you <em>do</em> meet the
general of whom you approve, we should
advise you just to drop him a line and let him
know. It will warm the poor old fellow up.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hungry Always.</span>—Yes, soft—or light—diet
is absolutely necessary in treatment for dysentery
or gastritis. If you think you know better
than the doctor, experiment with green quinces
and lemonade.... Let’s know how you get
on.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Chaplain of the —th.</span>—Dear kind-hearted
old chap! Haven’t you quite enough to do
here without worrying your head over the
progress of war-relief funds in Australia?
Anyhow, it may please you to know that it is
proposed to impose a special fine for every
time the word “blanky” is used by men or
officers; the proceeds to go to the various
funds. So you need have no fear of the said
funds not reaching the million £ mark in
quite a short time now.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Seedee Bot.</span>—You can’t expect us to
diagnose your complaint if you don’t make
your symptoms clear. But if you feel that
a torchlight procession is going on in your
interior, you have probably exposed yourself
too suddenly to an attack of Cambridge
sausages and tinned peaches. Try a change
of diet, say, whisky and Schweppes with steak
and kidney pudding.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Undignified.</span>—We sympathise with you
deeply in your suffering from the effects of
a shrapnel pellet. Naturally, every man on
returning to his country would be proud to
display to his admiring relatives and friends
those honourable scars received on active
service. You had bad luck, but at the same
time you should not have tried the ostrich
act when the shell burst.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Parcel Post.</span>—You say you wouldn’t mind
an occasional case of eat-and-drinkables in
the parcel as well as the socks and shirts and
box of liquorice powders. They will all be
useful, but anyway, think of your poor flurried
aunts and sisters at home, fighting their way
with knitting-needles—wild-eyed and tousle-haired—through
a deadly maze of skein-wool
entanglements! It’s horrible! We’re better
off where <em>we</em> are.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Adjutant.</span>—Yes, it’s a pity that one of your
men—such a seasoned veteran and a capable
and obedient soldier, too—should have such
kleptomaniacal tendencies. But we wouldn’t
advise you to have him sent back. Make
him your batman, instead.... Why, the
man was born for the position!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Fuzzy.</span>—Your suggestions will be handed
on to the proper quarters. The only objection
to the suggested cinema show at Reserve
Gully might be that the boys in the firing
trenches would make it too hot “sneakin’ off
to the pitchers” every night.... Afraid
you’ve no hope of seeing a pub built over
the road, opposite William’s Pier.... Yes,
it’s possible that our motor wagons might run
penny section moonlight trips to Salt Lake
and back to Anzac. But we fear that there
is no hope of a <em>palais-de-danse</em> there.</p>

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.

This website includes information about Project Gutenberg&#8482;,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
